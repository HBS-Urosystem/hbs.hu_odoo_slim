It has only been in recent years that interstitial cystitis (IC)  sometimes referred to as bladder pain syndrome (but many  patients do not have pain) has become more widely known  and understood. Twenty five years ago IC was thought  to be a rare disease that affected only people with severe  symptoms and who had a destroyed and shrunken bladder.  The median age at diagnosis was over 50 plus years of  age and fewer than 50,000 people in Unites States were  diagnosed with the disease. It was the lack of knowledge that  relegated IC to an orphan disease state (1). But IC like any  disease does have a beginning, a time when the symptoms  are mild and intermittent and clinicians assign various  traditional diagnoses based on their specialty, primary  care versus gynecology versus urology. By interviewing IC  patients who fulfill the classic severely symptomatic patient  it can be recognized that the disease begins with mild  intermittent symptoms that progress slowly until the disease  is so intense that most doctors would recognize it. But  during the “early years” of the disease much effort is wasted  on incorrect diagnoses leading to treatments and medical  care that does not help the patient. The recurrent symptom  flares drive the patient to repeated MD visits, tests and  Original Article How does interstitial cystitis begin? C.

To determine how IC develops patients  were interviewed on when their symptoms began, what they were and are now as well as the various  diagnoses that they received before they were determined to have IC. Methods:  One hundred female IC patients were screened. They filled out a questionnaire asking about the  age their disease presented, their initial and current symptoms, what their original diagnoses were, effect of  the menstrual cycle and sexual activity on their symptoms and about any relatives with bladder symptoms or  a current diagnosis of IC. Results:  By age 30, 81% of patients had bladder symptoms, 21% before age 10. The first symptom was  frequency in 81%, pain present in 59% and the symptoms were intermittent in 64%. Most common early  misdiagnosis was UTI in 74% with 93% reporting negative urine cultures. Sex was painful and causes  symptom flares in 82%, symptoms flared the week before the menses in 75%. Most common gynecologic  diagnosis was yeast vaginitis, 42%. Urge incontinence was present in 33%. There were 51% that reported  bladder symptoms in a first degree female relative. Conclusions:  IC begins primarily with frequency and is intermittent in most patients with symptom flares  associated with sexual activity. Pain and urgency incontinence tend to be a later symptoms. When IC flares  the most common misdiagnosis is UTI. Symptoms begin before age 30 in most but an IC diagnosis is often  not made until age 40. Genetics appear to play a significant role. It is important to consider these facts when  evaluating women with “early IC” because correct diagnosis will result in proper therapy and reduced health  care costs.

First degree relatives  with similar bladder symptoms are listed in  Table 6 . Discussion The main reason that these data were obtained was to  explore the issue of how does IC begin. I have evaluated  more than 9,000 people with IC over the past 35 plus years  and during that time have done extensive basic laboratory  and clinical research on IC. From this research I have  come to believe that there is one primary disease process  that causes bladder symptoms in females at all ages and  in males less than 55 years of age (3). That process is a  dysfunction of the mucus barrier (GAG layer) at the bladder  epithelial surface. This layer is the reason that the normal  epithelium is relatively impermeable to small molecules  Table 1  Patients at time of screening Median age  40 Presence of frequency/urgency 100% Presence of bladder associated pain 92% Presence of bladder/pelvic pain 100% Incontinence 39% Urgency incontinence 33% Stress Incontinence 9% Bladder pain worse with filling relieved by emptying 43% No effect from bladder filling 24% Pain worse with voiding 29% Table 2  Age interstitial cystitis (IC) symptoms appeared Age 10 or less  21% Saw MD 15% Diagnosed with UTI 9% Age 11-17 11% Age 20 or less 52% Age 30 or less 81% Age over 50 5% MD, medical doctor; UTI, urinary tract infection.

Gynecologists see over 15 million  women with CPP they so they probably see far more  IC patients than urologists. This study was done by an  urologist so gynecologic CPP patients were not screened.  In summary IC begins with mild symptoms usually  frequency/urgency (33% will ultimately develop urgency  incontinence) that is slowly and insidiously progressive.  Pain is often a later symptom but many patients may never  develop it. In the early phase of IC the symptom flares are  intermittent in most patients. Over time symptoms increase  and pain cycles may appear and last for 3-14 days. When  these cycles become more frequent and last longer they  are likely to be referred to a specialist. The most common  misdiagnosis is urinary infection followed by yeast vaginitis,  endometriosis and vulvodynia. Sexual activity is usually  painful and causes a symptom flare in most and symptoms  are affected by the menstrual cycle, increasing the week  before and during the menses. Over 50% of patients will  have a first degree relative with similar symptoms. If one  is seeing a woman with this history and her urine culture  is negative then the diagnosis is easy, she has interstitial  cystitis and therapy should be initiated.   Acknowledgements None.

The key point is that most doctors incorrectly  diagnose the acute flares of IC as UTI until cultures are  repeatedly negative, occur multiple times or the symptoms  fail to resolve with antibiotic therapy. Even one negative  culture with a flare should alert the doctor to the fact that  these episodes are not infectious and point to the only  other diagnosis the patient could have IC (or if one prefers    early IC). The patients in this study were seeing an urologist  but many had seen a gynecologist for their symptoms  and received diagnoses of yeast vaginitis, endometriosis  or vulvodynia. It does appear from the literature that  a substantial majority of IC patients is actually seeing  gynecologists for their bladder pain and are misdiagnosed  by them as vulvodynia, endometriosis, yeast vaginitis or just  chronic pelvic pain (origin not known) (5-9). In the absence of knowledge concerning the  pathophysiology and diagnosis of a medical disease  (syndrome) there are often attempts to rename the disease  frequently by its symptoms in order to begin a new era of  research activity. In urology, prostatitis is a good example of  this phenomenon. It has been reclassified 3 times in the last  40 years. In recent years a similar attempt has been made  to rename IC as “bladder pain syndrome” in the absence  of any scientific evidence to support this reclassification.  Often patients with IC have no pain and these data show  that many patients present only with frequency issues and  develop pain at a later time. But many seek a doctor for  their frequency problems and what do they have at this  point in time in terms of diagnosis? They have “early” IC  or simply IC. Similar problem with the term OAB, these  patients were so diagnosed because they have no pain and  it is often argued that they do not have IC. But these data  show patients saw MDs before they had experienced pain.  So by definition they would have “OAB” in this earlier  time period but ultimately they were diagnosed with IC.  Scientific evidence shows that OAB patients have the same  epithelial dysfunction as does the IC patient (4,10). There  are those that argue that there is an overlap of these two  conditions but the scientific evidence supports the fact that  both are one disease, bladder epithelial dysfunction (3).    Since the urethra is often involved the term lower urinary  dysfunctional epithelium (LUDE) is more accurate (3).  Perhaps it is time to remove the syndrome label from  IC and OAB since they can now be defined by their  pathophysiology, LUDE (3). The genetic issue is quite real. There were 51% who had  a first degree female relative with bladder symptoms and  13% a first degree male relative who had similar bladder  symptoms. These results are summarized in  Table 6 . These data provide the clinician with useful information  to aid in the diagnosis of IC. It is often said it is a difficult  diagnosis to make but this not true. It is an easy diagnosis  when you realize the disease begins with urinary frequency  and progresses slowly with intermittent flares of symptoms  of urinary frequency/urgency and/or pain. These flares  usually occur after sexual activity and sex is painful.  Significant symptoms are already present in over 80%  of people who develop IC by age 30. The problem is the  median age of diagnosis (which is steadily dropping) is still  close to age 40 so most patients are incorrectly diagnosed  at a time when they would respond better to therapy. So  at the end of the day if a urologist is seeing a 25-year-old  female for the following reasons, recurrent symptoms of  urinary urgency/frequency and/or bladder pain or voiding  associated pain, a history of negative urinary cultures when  symptomatic (no how many were “positive”). Sexual activity  is painful, her symptoms are worse just before or during  her menses, has a mother or sister with similar symptoms  and today she is symptomatic only one test is needed, urine  analysis or catheterized urine for culture that shows no  infection. There is only one thing she could have, IC. The  diagnosis is easy so proceed to therapy. This study has several weaknesses. First the data obtained  was from recall but most subjects felt they were reasonably  accurate about their responses and this may not be a  significant problem due to the nature of the questions that  were asked. Recall of childhood problems with the bladder  was only reported as positive if the subject was definite  about it. Some people were not sure or could not remember  so the actual incidence of childhood bladder problems may  be higher. Another weakness is that these were urologic  patients presenting to an urologist so the bias is that they  would only see a GU if they had obvious bladder symptoms  of urgency/frequency or definite pelvic pain they associated  with the bladder. Many people with IC are not bothered by  their frequency (they think their 12 voids a day is normal,  it is for them) so when they have pelvic pain affected by  their menstrual cycle and have pain with sex they seek  a gynecologist for their problem because it appears to  them to be gynecologic in nature. The gynecologist rarely  solicits information about voiding symptoms and since the  patients don’t perceive they have any frequency they end  up with a gynecologic diagnosis. As mentioned previously  when gynecologic CPP patients were screened for IC in  five reported studies with a symptom questionnaire that  </p>

When an epithelial dysfunction occurs, potassium is the  principal solute that leaks into the bladder wall and causes  depolarization of bladder nerves and muscle resulting  in the symptoms of urgency/frequency, pain or urinary  incontinence in any combination (3). The severe phase of  this disease process is the traditional IC patient. But IC has  to have a beginning and in the early phase of IC symptoms  are milder, intermittent, develop slowly and numerous  incorrect diagnoses are given as shown by these data. Patient histories I have taken have many common threads  and one does develop an impression for how the disease  begins. It is my observation that the first symptom is usually  a slow insidiously progressive frequency. The patient does  not present for help from a physician until it bothers them  such as voiding every hour, multiple episodes of nocturia  or has post void urgency. But after time many will note the  onset of pain cycles that appear suddenly are intense and  drive the patient to seek medical care. These cycles typically  occur after sexual activity and last for 3-14 days and then  resolve. Most are diagnosed with a urinary infection and will  receive antibiotics regardless of the results of a urine culture  (often negative). Others will receive no actual diagnosis  or treatment. When the flares are multiple in a short time  period or last for weeks and months then they are referred  to urology. Initially the symptom flares are intermittent but  even at base line the patients are likely to have increased  frequency of urination that they don’t necessarily perceive  as abnormal, they have always had this so it is normal to  them. Many of the patients may not develop pain cycles  but when their urgency/frequency progresses and becomes  bothersome they will seek medical care and receive the  “overactive bladder diagnosis” (OAB). This diagnosis is  separated from IC only by an arbitrary definition and not  on scientific evidence. And in fact, 73% of OAB patients  have been reported to have a positive potassium sensitivity  test (PST) consistent with an IC diagnosis (4). The current  study was conducted to obtain data to determine whether  or not these impressions were valid. And the data reported  here are consistent with this overall concept. The onset of bladder symptoms reported by the patients  ( Table 1 ) began before age 10 in 21%, by age 20 in 52% and  before age 30, 81%. The first symptoms were frequency/ urgency in 81% while only 54% reported the presence  of pain and 43% had both frequency and pain. Only 5%  reported the onset of bladder symptoms after age 50. At  the time of this survey 39% reported incontinence of urine,  85% of whom had urgency incontinence. This problem  did not appear in most of the patients until after age 35.  Symptoms were initially intermittent in the majority of  patients, 64%.  Sexually activity cause pain and symptom flares in 74%.  There were 65 who currently had menstrual cycles and  74% reported that their cycle affected symptoms. Most  experience flares the week before their period, 75% ( Table 4 ). The classic pain associated with the diagnosis of IC  is “pain made worse with bladder filling and relieved  by emptying.” But this is usually not the case only 43%  reported this symptom. In fact voiding provoked the bladder  pain is 29% contrary to the classic definition. Then there is  the issue of all the chronic pelvic pain (CPP) patients that  see gynecologists most of whom (80%) appear to have the  bladder as the source of the pain (5-9). These patients see  the gynecologist because they do not perceive the bladder  as the cause of the pain or else they would be seeing an  urologist. So it would appear that many more IC patients  do not have “classic pain.” Unfortunately most urologists  including many experts in IC confine their observations to  only those patients seeing them for pain and are unaware  that they majority of patients with bladder generated pain  are not seeing Urologists. These traditional concepts have  to be changed incorporating all of the new data so that  patients can be correctly diagnosed and treated.  Interestingly 21% of the patients reported childhood  bladder problems at age 10 or less, most, 75% saw an  MD for this problem. The most common diagnosis was  urinary infection, 60%. Others were told they had a  urethral problem, anxiety, small bladder or the physician  did not know what caused the symptoms. An important  point is most of these patients after having a number of  flares of symptoms go into a remission until they become  sexually active. This emphasizes the intermittent nature  of the disease and the fact that IC often does not fulfill the  NIDDK criteria but then they were never meant to be  the final answer for an IC diagnosis but only criteria for  research purposes.  Table 5  lists the diagnoses patients received before  being told they had IC. Not surprisingly urinary infection  was number one at 74%, of interest, 93% were told of  having at least one or more negative cultures when having  a symptomatic flare. There is a concept that somehow  UTIs may play a causal role in IC. But I believe and my  experience has taught me that recurrent UTIs in a female  are quite rare. This is supported by these data where over  90% of the patients had negative cultures with symptom  </p>

To help IC patients one must correctly diagnose the  disease in order to utilize therapy that will help the person  and there are good treatments for IC today. This study was  done to help develop an understanding of how the disease  begins, what the key symptoms are and how it progresses  all of which will aid in the correct diagnosis of IC earlier  in the disease process. To accomplish this goal 100 patients  filled out a questionnaire and were interviewed on when  their symptoms began, what they were and are now as well  as the various diagnoses that they received before they were  determined to have IC. Materials and methods  Subjects Subjects were from one urologist’s practice at the University  of California San Diego. They were serially selected from  patients presenting for either a new patient visit of a return  visit. One hundred female subjects were recruited and  signed an informed consent. All of them met the clinical  NIDDK criteria (no cystoscopy required) for IC (2). They  filled out a questionnaire asking about the age their disease  presented, their initial and current symptoms, what their  original diagnoses were, effect of the menstrual cycle and  sexual activity on their symptoms and about any relatives  with bladder symptoms or a current diagnosis of IC. Their  responses were reviewed with the principal investigator. Initial symptoms They patients were asked at what age they first noted  bladder symptoms and what they were, frequency, urgency,  and/or bladder pain. They were asked if at the onset of their  symptoms if they were either intermittent or continuous. Current symptoms The patients were asked what their current symptoms are  including frequency, urgency, bladder or pelvic pain, and  urinary incontinence.  Diagnoses prior to IC diagnosis The patients were asked what their initial diagnoses were  and if they received any associated gynecologic diagnoses.  If they had a diagnosis of recurrent urinary tract infections  (UTI), they were asked if they had been told that they had  negative cultures during a flare of their bladder symptoms.  Gynecologic symptoms They reported the effect of sexual activity on their pain  and whether or not they had post intercourse flares of their  bladder symptoms. For those that had a menstrual cycle  the effect of it on their symptoms was recorded as to when  during their cycle the symptoms flared. Patients’ that had childhood symptoms of IC Each subject was queried about childhood bladder  symptoms, at what age they presented, whether or not they  had seen a doctor for these problems and if they knew the  diagnosis they were given if any.  First degree relatives with bladder symptoms Patients were asked if any male or female relatives had  bladder symptoms similar to their own symptoms. They  reported on mothers, sisters, daughters, father, brothers or  sons who had problems. Results A total of 100 females with IC were evaluated. At the time  of this survey the median age of the females was 40 ( Table 1 ).  All reported frequency and urgency, 92% reported bladder  associated pain and another 8% reported pelvic pain since  they were not able to distinguish the bladder as the source.  Urinary incontinence was present in 39% and 85% of these  patients stated it was urgency incontinence. Of those with  bladder associated pain, 43% reported the pain was worse  with filling and relieved by emptying, 24% were not worse  with filling and 29% had worse pain with voiding ( Table 1 ).  The age that IC symptoms began are shown it  Table 2  and  Table 3  lists the first symptoms that were experienced.  There were 21% of the patients reported seeing an MD  for their symptoms as a child less that age 10 ( Table 1 ). The  most common diagnosis was UTI (60%). Other diagnoses  included urethral problem, anxiety, small bladder or no  diagnosis was given. Sexual and menstrual cycle effects on symptoms are  reported in  Table 4 . Diagnoses the patients received before  an IC diagnosis are in  Table 5 . UTI was the most common  </p>
