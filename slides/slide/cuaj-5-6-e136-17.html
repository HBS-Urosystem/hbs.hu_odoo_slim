To differentiate between the  pain  originating from   urinary  bladder   from that of other pelvic organs, Taneja et al treated  22 women with pelvic   pain   with   20 mL of 2% intravesical  lidocaine solution. Sixty-eight percent experienced a reduc - tion of pain by 50% or greater. All non-responders were  subsequently diagnosed with non-bladder pathology causing  their pelvic pain. 47 With no risk of symptom flare, the anesthetic bladder  challenge may be considered when there is uncertainty as  to whether the pain is originating from the bladder. 10. Hydrodistension (OPTIONAL, select patients, Grade C, Level 3  evidence) Hydrodistension (HD) under general anesthetic allows for  stratification of patients into those with more classic disease  associated with ulcers and glomerulations from those with  no obvious mucosal abnormalities. 3  The technique of diag - nostic HD generally involves gravity filling of the bladder at  70 ‒ 100 cmH 2 0 for a minimum of two minutes, performed  under general or regional anesthetic. Maximum anesthetic  capacity is determined whereby the inflow backs up in the  drip chamber or leakage occurs per urethra despite com - pression against the cystoscope. While severely reduced  anesthetic bladder capacities (&lt;400 mL) do correlate with  pain, 33  more than 50% of patients with IC/BPS show capaci - ties more than 800 mL.   The presence of terminal hematuria upon draining the  infusion fluid and the appearance of petechial submuco - sal hemorrhages (glomerulations) has been suggested to be  characteristic of IC/BPS and is one of the prerequisite find - ings in the NIDDK criteria. 3  Glomerulation severity has also  been graded.   A possible relationship between glomerulations  and angiogenic growth factors has been found, suggesting  that these growth factors may have an important role in the  pathogenesis of IC/BPS. 48 Despite the initial adoption of the HD findings of glo - merulations as a criteria for the diagnosis of IC/BPS by the  National Institutes of Health (NIH), approximately eight  percent with a diagnosis of IC/BPS do not show glomerula - tions. 19,32  The severity of glomerulations was found to cor - relate poorly with symptoms and with histological evidence  of inflammation. 49  In contrast, Lamale et al found a strong  correlation with pain and HD findings. 50  Their series was  small (12 patients), including perhaps more severe patients,  as evidenced by a mean anesthetic bladder capacity of 604  mL, but represented an untreated cohort where they postu - lated there were no confounders of treatment allowing a true  correlation to be identified. In another series of 84 patients,  cystoscopy with HD provided little useful information above  and beyond the history and physical examination findings. 19   Additionally, the specificity of glomerulations was brought  into question when Waxman et al found characteristic glo - merulations in 45% of 20 normal women who consented  to undergo HD at the time of tubal ligation. 51     As the literature is conflicting regarding its utility, HD for  diagnostic purposes may be appropriate in certain situations.  These may include: when a patient is unable to tolerate  cystoscopy under local anesthetic and is having a general  anesthetic; when a patient has failed other treatment options  and HD to assess disease severity may contribute informa - tion to the diagnosis; and when assessing a patient for clini - cal trial eligibility.  11. Urodynamics (UDS) (NOT RECOMMENDED in the routine evaluation  of IC/BPS, Grade C, Level 3 evidence) Filling cystometrogram (CMG) has been advocated by some  for the diagnosis of IC/BPS. 3,52  Certainly there is overlap  between the conditions of OAB-dry and symptoms of IC/ BPS, and the finding of detrusor overactivity (DO) on filling  CMG may lead the clinician to initiate therapy with anti - cholinergic agents.   According to the NIDDK criteria, the finding of a capacity  &gt;350 mL, first sensation of having to void &gt;150 mL, or the  presence of DO are exclusionary for a diagnosis of classic  IC. 3  However, it is recognized that approximately 15% of  patients diagnosed with IC/BPS will demonstrate DO 53  and,  thus, the coexistence of urge incontinence or DO should not  preclude a diagnosis of IC/BPS. Other findings on UDS from  the IC database study were a reduced first sensation to void  (mean 81 ± 64 mL) and maximum sensory capacity (mean  198 ± 107 mL). While these UDS parameters do correlate  well with frequency, nocturia, and urgency, they have not  been well-correlated to global pain, cystoscopic findings  at HD (other than the presence of a Hunner’s lesions), or  results of therapeutic intervention.   Bladder capacity may be assessed less invasively and  more cost effectively by means of a frequency volume chart  with self-measurement of voided volumes; this has been  shown to correlate with maximum cystometric capacity and  first sensation of having to void in patients with IC/BPS. 33,53  If  a cystoscopy under local anesthetic is planned, a functional  bladder capacity and its relation to the patient’s pain can be  assessed with patient awake. Pressure flow studies, with or without electromyography,  may be useful in some situations where there are coexistent  voiding symptoms with suspicion of bladder outlet obstruc - tion or voiding dysfunction due to high-tone pelvic floor  dysfunction. Overall, UDS studies are not recommended in the stan - dard diagnostic evaluation of a patient suspected of having  IC/BPS. </p>

Methodology The  following  guidelines  were  based  on  MEDLINE  and  PUBMED searches of English language literature, in addi - tion to consensus conference proceedings. Levels of evi - dence and grades of recommendation were assigned for  each investigation and treatment, as per the modified Oxford  Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine grading system. Where  the literature was inconsistent or scarce, a consensus expert  opinion was generated to provide treatment guidelines.   Introduction Terminology Much confusion regarding the diagnosis of this clinical syn - drome is due to many changes in definition and nomencla - ture since its first description in 1887 by Skene. 1  The condi - tion classically known as interstitial cystitis (IC) was reserved  for patients with typical cystoscopic findings, such as glo - merulations, or the classic bladder wall Hunner’s ulcer. 2 Up until 2002, the National Institute for Diabetes and  Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria were used  to define IC. 3  However, it was recognized that the NIDDK  criteria were designed to delineate a homogeneous popula - tion for research trials and were overly restrictive for use in  routine clinical practice. 4  Therefore, in 2002, the International  Continence Society defined painful bladder syndrome (PBS) as:  “The complaint of suprapubic pain, related to bladder filling  accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime  and nighttime frequency, in the absence of proven urinary  infection or other obvious pathology” of the lower urinary  tract. 5  Subsequent to this definition, some used IC to reflect  patients who meet the classic NIDDK criteria and PBS to reflect  those with identical symptoms, but who did not undergo formal  hydrodistension or did not meet all of the NIDDK criteria.  Due to similarities with IC/PBS and other chronic pain  syndromes, the European Society for the Study of IC/BPS  (ESSIC) provided a new definition, which was more descrip - tive of the clinical syndrome and the underlying pathol - ogy.   This expanded term, bladder pain syndrome (BPS),  describes all patients with “chronic pelvic pain, pressure,  or discomfort, perceived to be related to the urinary bladder  accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom: persis - tent urgency or urinary frequency.” 6  To include all patients  with bladder pain, in 2010, the International Consultation  of Incontinence accepted this revised definition. 7  In 2009,  the Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology (SUFU)  defined the term IC/BPS as “an unpleasant sensation (pain,  pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary  bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms for  more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection  or other identifiable causes.” This is the definition used by  the American Urological Association (AUA) in the most  recent guidelines on IC/BPS. This is the definition that will  be referred to for the purpose of this guideline.  The corresponding French terminology is cystite inter - stitielle, cystalgie à urine claire, or cystalgie abacterienne. Epidemiology There is wide variation in reported incidence and prevalence  of IC/BPS depending on the criteria used for diagnosis. Current  studies estimate that between 2.7 and 6.5% of American women  have symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of IC/BPS. 8,9  The  broad range in incidence depends on whether highly sensitive  or highly specific defining criteria are used — further highlight - ing the need for a standardized diagnostic algorithm.

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E137 This translates into approximately 3.3 ‒ 7.9 million women  over the age of 18 years in the U.S. affected by symptoms of  IC/BPS. Of these women, however, only 9.7% report being  diagnosed with IC/BPS. 10  In addition, this study found that  women with the diagnosis of IC/BPS were significantly more  likely to be uninsured, less likely to be married, and had  more children than controls. Of patients with IC, 94% are  White and the median age is 40 years. Although the disease can affect both sexes, approximately  90% are female. In addition, the condition is dramatically  under-reported in men. There is significant overlap of symp - toms of IC/BPS to those of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic  pain syndrome, with 17% of men found to have symptoms  of both complexes. 11 Diagnosis of IC/BPS 1. History (MANDATORY, all patients, Grade C, Level 4 evidence) A  thorough  general  medical  history  is  of  paramount  importance to identify typical diagnostic symptoms of IC/ BPS and other potential mimicking causative conditions.  Unfortunately, delay of diagnosis is common, with an aver - age time of three to seven years from the time of presentation  to the general practitioner to diagnosis by a specialist. 12,13   The  characteristic  presentation  of  IC/BPS  includes  a  combination of pain, frequency, nocturia, and urgency.  The onset of symptoms may be gradual and/or with only a  single voiding symptom; however, pelvic pain is the main  descriptor of IC/BPS. 14  In early or milder IC/BPS, patients  may not describe frank pain, but rather describe sensations  of “pressure,” “burning,” “sharp,” or “uncomfortable sensa - tion of having to urinate.” Typically this sensation is felt in  the supra-pubic area, but it can be referred to areas located  in the pelvis, including the urethra, vagina, labia, inguinal  area, perineum, and/or lower abdomen or back.  The location of pain, relation to bladder filling/emptying  duration, and a description of the type of pain can all be  useful. Pain that occurs only during voiding is not consistent  with IC/BPS, and vulvar disorders, which cause pain when  urine makes contact with the vulva, should instead be con - sidered. Symptoms of IC/BPS are generally worse a few days  prior to menses, in contrast to endometriosis, which is worse  during menses. Patients may describe “flares,” or periods  of worsening symptoms, which may be triggered by stress,  intercourse, menses, or diet. Common triggers include cof - fee, alcohol, citrus fruits, tomatoes, carbonated beverages,  and spicy foods. 15 The most common presenting symptom, however, is fre - quency, estimated to be 92% of one population. 12,16  Urgency  is also prevalent, however, cannot distinguish IC/BPS from  overactive bladder (OAB). 17  Typically, the difference is that  patients with IC/BPS void to relieve pain, whereas OAB  patients void for fear of incontinence. A good response to  antimuscarinics suggests OAB, however, be cautious that this  may confound the diagnosis, as the disorders may coexist.  Despite the absence of urinary infection (UTI) being a  prerequisite at the time of diagnosis, up to 50% of patients  will have a previous history of UTI.  It is important to elicit a  comprehensive medical history, including past pelvic surgery  or radiation, medications that can cause cystitis (nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclophosphamide, and ketamine),  fibromyalgia, depression, sexual dysfunction, autoimmune  diseases, allergies, and other gynecological conditions (vul - vodynia, endometriosis, dyspareunia). Not only is the past  medical history important for diagnosis, but also because  many of these conditions may co-exist, further stressing the  importance of multidisciplinary management. Table 1 sum - marizes relevant diseases that may be confused with IC/BPS. 2. Physical examination (MANDATORY, all patients, Grade C, Level  4 evidence) The physical exam should include an abdominal and pelvic  exam, with particular focus on looking for masses, blad - der distension, hernias, and tenderness. A musculoskeletal  and focused neurological exam may also be contributory.  Although there is no physical finding specific to patients  with IC/BPS, suprapubic tenderness and bladder neck point  tenderness, in both men and women, is very often noted. In  men, tenderness may be elicited by palpating the perineal  area between the scrotum and anus; in women, palpating  the anterior vaginal wall along the course of the urethra up  to the bladder neck may elicit pain.  Peters et al demonstrated an association between IC/ BPS and pelvic floor dysfunction in a study of 70 women,  i C/BPS guideline Table 1.

Bladder biopsy (NOT RECOMMENDED in the routine evaluation of  IC/BPS, Grade C, Level 3 evidence) There are no specific features found on bladder biopsy to  confirm a diagnosis of IC/BPS. Findings related to chronic  inflammation are not specific, overlapping with other eti - ologies, and they correlate poorly to cystoscopic findings  observed  during  hydrodistension. 49   Between  30% 49   and  43% 54  of patients with a clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS may  have normal histology. However, correlations have been found with specific  types of pathological findings and symptoms. Mucosal denu - dation (i.e., Hunner’s lesions) and submucosal hemorrhage  was highly associated with pain; mast cell count on tryptase  stain, complete loss of urothelium, granulation tissue in the  lamina propria, and vascular density were associated with  nocturia in a multivariate analysis of patients from the IC  database. 55  The importance of mast cells has been contro - versial. Dundore et al found no significant difference in mast  cell counts in the lamina propria or detrusor on Giemsa- stained sections between IC/BPS patients compared to con - trols. 56  Because an association between specific pathological  features and symptoms may exist, it is reasonable to include  a bladder biopsy and pathological classification in future  research studies.   When a biopsy is indicated for research or to rule out  carcinoma in situ if suspected by a focal lesion or abnormal  cytology, this should be performed from the most abnormal  appearing area and should follow HD to avoid increased  risk of bladder perforation.   Routine bladder biopsies are not recommended for the  diagnosis of IC/BPS, but may be considered in research trials  or to rule out other specific diagnosis, such as carcinoma in  situ, when clinically indicated. Treatment of IC/BPS The purpose of this guideline is to aid clinicians in the treat - ment of patients diagnosed with IC/BPS. The main goals of  treatment should be maximizing symptomatic control and  quality of life while avoiding adverse events and treatment  complications, recognizing that there is no curative treat - ment for this condition. Goals of therapy must be realistic  and mutually agreed upon between the physician and the  patient. IC/BPS can progress to include symptoms outside  the bladder, and identification and treatment of associated  conditions with early referral to other specialists for multi - disciplinary management is of paramount importance. Treatment should be individualized to each patient, with  a focus on the specific symptom complex or phenotype of  that patient. The application of an algorithmic approach  for the treatment of all patients may lead to unsuccessful  outcomes. Fig. 1 is provided to aid the clinician with an  approach to the treatment of the IC/BPS patient, recognizing  that following a single algorithm is not currently appropriate  for the treatment of IC/BPS. A. Conservative therapies 1. Patient education (RECOMMENDED in all patients, Grade A) and dietary  modifications (RECOMMENDED in all patients, Grade B)  Based  on  best  evidence  principles,  initial  management  should  focus  on  conservative  strategies.  These  include  patient education, diet and lifestyle changes, and bladder  training for all patients. Significant improvement in 45 ‒ 50%  of patients may be expected with only advice and support,  as demonstrated in two well-designed, randomized trials. 57,58   Bosch et al have developed a practical IC/BPS standard  advice checklist to insure all healthcare topics are discussed  with the patient. 58 Up to 90% of patients have exacerbations of their symp - toms after ingesting certain foods or drinks. 15,59  Based on  survey studies, common food triggers include coffee, tea,  citrus fruits, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, bananas,  tomatoes, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, vitamin C, and  wheat products. 15,59,60  Only one placebo-controlled, random - ized, controlled trial (RCT) on the effect of diet in IC/BPS  has been published, which failed to report any significant  association. 61  Dietary modifications, such as a steady intake  of water to dilute urine and reduce constipation, 62  and an  elimination diet trial have been advocated. No standardized  protocol exists, but common practice is to instruct patients  to avoid all foods on the list for a period varying from one  week to three months and then methodically re-introduce  one item at a time, with a waiting period of three days to  identify potential offenders. 60,62   2. Bladder training (RECOMMENDED in motivated patients, Grade B) Bladder training can be initiated with other lifestyle interven - tions. The goal is to reduce voiding frequency, potentially  increase bladder capacity, and reduce the need to void in  response to urgency or pain. Timed voiding or scheduled  voiding involves urinating at regular set intervals that dis - regard the normal urge to void. 63  With the urge suppression  strategy, patients are instructed to delay urination by grad - ually increasing the interval from when the urge is felt to  when they actually void. Distraction (counting backwards)  or relaxation (deep breathing) techniques may be used. The  most appropriate protocol is not clear at this point. 64  These  are quite innocuous, but time-consuming techniques that  require a highly motivated patient. 65  The effectiveness of  such behaviour modification program is supported by pro - spective data showing symptom improvement for 45 ‒ 88%  of the cohorts. 66 </p>
                                        
                                            <p>9. CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E144 Cox et al. of 50 mg or higher (66% vs. 47%, p=0.01). Based on the  intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant differ - ence between groups (55% vs. 45%, p=0.12). Of note, less  than 50% of patients tolerated a dose of 50 mg and both  groups received standardized education and behavioural  modification counselling, which may have contributed to  the high response rate in the placebo group.  Side effects  were common, seen in 88% and 72% of the treatment and  placebo groups, respectively.  Guideline: Based on Level 1 and 2 evidence, amitriptyline  is an option for the treatment of IC/BPS after conservative  therapies have failed.  2. Cimetidine (OPTION, Grade B) Two very small observational trials 81,82  and one placebo- controlled RCT 83  have shown an improvement in symptoms  of IC/BPS with cimetidine at various dosages. Thilagarajah  et al 83  randomized 36 patients to cimetidine 400 mg orally  twice daily vs. placebo and reported a significant improve - ment in symptoms in the cimetidine vs. placebo groups,  respectively. Suprapubic pain and nocturia were found to  be the most improved with cimetidine. No side effects were  reported. Guideline: Based on scarce Level 1, 2, and 3 evidence,  cimetidine 400 mg orally twice daily is an option for the  treatment  of  IC/BPS  after  conservative  therapies  have  failed. 3. Hydroxyzine (OPTION for patients with allergic phenotype, Grade C) One observational study reported a 40% reduction in symp - toms scores and pain compared to baseline. 84  One RCT  compared placebo vs. hydroxyzine alone vs. PPS alone  vs. a combination of hydroxyzine and PPS. There was no  significant difference in symptom improvement between  the hydroxyzine alone and placebo groups (23% vs. 13%).  However, the addition of hydroxyzine to PPS did improve  the rate of success compared to PPS alone (40% vs. 28%). 85   Side effects were common in all groups and primarily con - sisted of constitutional symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms,  and pain.  Guideline: There are few studies and conflicting results  for the use of hydroxyzine for the treatment of IC/BPS.  Observational studies are encouraging and the medication  appears safe. Based on Level 3 evidence, hydroxazine may  be considered an option (perhaps in patients with an allergy  history) after conservative measures have failed. 4. Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) (OPTION, Grade D) Multiple placebo-controlled RCTs exist comparing PPS to  placebo 85-89  reporting contradictory results. A meta-analysis  including data on 448 patients has summarized the findings  of four of these trials. 90  The primary outcome of success  was defined as a 50% or more improvement in symptoms,  including  pain,  urgency,  frequency,  and  nocturia.  The  overall success rate of PPS was: pain 37%; urgency 28%;  frequency 54%; and nocturia 48%. All were significantly  improved over placebo, with the exception of nocturia.  Observational trials have assessed the long-term benefit of  PPS with variable results. At a mean followup of 22 months,  Alzharani et al 91  found that 54.2% of patients treated with  PPS reported a &gt;50% improvement in symptoms, whereas  Jepsen et al 92  reported only 6.2 ‒ 18.7% of patients main - tained a benefit after 18 months of treatment. Nickel et al 93  studied the effect of dose escalation of PPS  in a RCT that was not placebo-controlled. They compared  300 mg vs. 600 mg vs. 900 mg of PPS per day in 380 sub - jects. At 32 weeks, 49.6%, 49.6%, and 45.2% of patients  reported a greater than 50% improvement in symptoms,  respectively. There was no significant difference between  dosages, but importantly, it was found that success rates  improved with longer duration of therapy. Common side  effects included: diarrhea (25%); headache (18.2%); nau - sea (15%); pelvic pain (13%); abdominal pain (13%); and  alopecia (5%). Twenty-two percent of patients discontinued  treatment due to side effects. Most recently, Nickel et al 94  reported the results of 368  patients randomized to placebo vs. PPS 100 mg once daily  vs. PPS 100 mg three time daily for 24 weeks. The primary  endpoint was defined as a 30% or greater reduction in ICSI  total score; 40.7%, 39.8%, and 42.6% of the placebo group,  PPS 100 mg once daily, and PPS 100 mg three time daily,  respectively, met the primary endpoint with no significant  difference between groups.   Guideline: Based on new conflicting Level 1 and 2 evidence,  PPS may be offered as an option for the treatment of IC/ BPS; however, expected benefits are predicted to be mar - ginal in the majority of patients. 5. Cyclosporine A (CyA) (OPTION as a last resort in patients with inflammation,  Grade C) Multiple observational trials of small sample sizes suggest  a positive treatment effect of CyA for IC/BPS. 95-98  Patients  with Hunner’s lesions seem to derive a better response than  those without Hunner’s lesions (68% vs. 30%, respective - ly). 96  A single RCT comparing CyA to PPS showed a signifi - cant improvement in IC/BPS symptoms with CyA treatment  compared to PPS (59% vs. 13%, p&lt;0.001). 99  This trial was  not placebo-controlled and side effects occurred in 94% of  CyA patients and 56% of PPS patients.  Following the theory that IC/BPS may be caused by an  autoimmune/inflammatory reaction, mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF) has also been studied in a placebo-controlled RCT.  </p>

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E143 i C/BPS guideline physical exam might benefit from various physical therapy  techniques, including: physiotherapy (± biofeedback); myo - fascial tender points release; or intravaginal Thiele massage.  Various techniques have been described that involve skillful,  hands-on maneuvers directed toward relaxation, elongation,  stretching, and massaging of tightened muscles. Physical  therapists with expertise in pelvic floor muscle relaxation  should be involved. Evidence supporting this management  option in IC/BPS is more robust, with RCTs and prospect - ive case series reporting moderate or marked improvement  of symptoms in 50 ‒ 62% of patients  72-75  and an additional  21% of patients having complete resolution of symptoms  in one study. 75 2. Acupuncture (OPTION in motivated patients, Grade B) Insertion of fine needles into specific points of the body  appears  to  be  an  effective  treatment  to  alleviate  IC/BPS  symptoms, according to a systematic review of 23 RCTs. 76   However, it was not possible to determine if efficacy was  beyond placebo effect due to inconsistencies in protocols  across studies. It remains a relatively non-invasive modality  that might be used as an adjunct to allopathic medicine. 3. Trigger point injections (OPTION for patients with trigger point pain, Grade D) Injections of pelvic floor trigger points using a 22 or 25  gauge needle with 1 ‒ 5 mL of a local anesthetic, with or  without glucocorticoid, has also been described, but only  anecdotal evidence suggests it may be effective in the treat - ment of IC/BPS. 77 Guideline: Based on Level 1 evidence, pelvic floor physio - therapy can be recommended for patients identified with  PFD, while some weak Level 2 evidence suggests that mas - sage techniques, acupuncture, and trigger point injections  are options for IC/BPS patients with pelvic floor tenderness. C. Medical therapies The  only  two  treatments  officially  approved  by  Health  Canada for IC/BPS are oral PPS and intravesical dimethy - sulfoxide (DMSO). All the other treatments discussed are  off-label uses. Table 2 provides a summary of the suggested  dosages for each treatment option discussed.  C1. Oral therapies 1. Amitriptyline (OPTION, Grade B) Observational  studies  have  shown  an  improvement  in  symptoms of IC/BPS with the use of amitriptyline. 78,79  Two  RCTs have demonstrated a benefit of amitriptyline over  placebo. 57,80  Van Ophoven et al 80  reported a statistically  significant improvement in O’Leary-Sant IC symptom and  problem index scores from baseline in patients treated with  amitriptyline vs. placebo (p=0.05). Overall, 63% vs. 4%  of the treatment group vs. placebo group were considered  significantly improved at four months followup.  Side effects  were common, with a reported rate of 92% vs. 21% in the  treatment vs. placebo groups, respectively. Most recently,  Foster et al 57  reported a statistically significant improvement  in global response assessment in treatment-naïve patients  treated with amitriptyline vs. placebo, but only at a dose  Table 2.

Side effects associated with BTX-A include UTI, hematu - ria, elevated post-void residual, and possible need for tem - porary clean intermittent catheterization.   Guideline: Based on consistent Level 3 evidence, the use of  intravesical BTX-A is an option for the treatment of IC/BPS  in patients refractory to other treatments. Repeat injections  are safe. Therapy is costly and may not be widely available  at all centres. Patients must be counselled on potential side  effects, particularly the possibility of urinary retention and  need to catheterize. 4. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) (OPTION, Grade C) SNM is not yet approved by Health Canada or the FDA  for the treatment of IC/BPS, but is indicated for urgency  frequency syndrome and urgency urinary incontinence. No  RCTs have been completed to assess the effect of SNM on  symptoms of IC/BPS. However, multiple observational stud - ies have been reported, 188-195  including long-term followup  of 86 ± 9.8 months. 191  All studies include patients refractory  to multiple IC/BPS treatment options.   Based on observational studies, 42 ‒ 95% of patients experi - ence at least a 50% improvement in overall urinary symptoms,  including pain. 189,192,193,195  Peters et al 192  found a statistically  significant decrease in narcotic use postoperatively (from 81.6  to 52 mg/day injectable morphine equivalents, p=0.015) with  4/18 patients stopping narcotic use completely. Potential side effects of SNM include failure to improve  symptoms, painful stimulation, uncomfortable sensations,  battery site pain, seroma, infection, mechanical malfunc - tion, and lead migration. There is a surgical revision rate  of 27–50%. 189,191 Guideline: Based on consistent Level 3 evidence, SNM may  be offered as an option for the treatment of IC/BPS to  patients who have symptoms refractory to multiple other  treatments. Therapy is costly and not widely available at  all centres. Patients must be counselled on potential side  effects, particularly the need for future surgical revisions.  E. Radical surgery (OPTION for severe refractory patients, Grade C) Multiple case series exist reporting on the use of invasive  surgical techniques for urinary diversion, with or without  cystectomy, in severe refractory patients. Supratrigonal cys - tectomy with augmentation cystoplasty (substitution cysto - plasty) has been reported to be beneficial in many series for  improving pain, urinary symptoms, and quality of life. 196-201   In a recent series, Anderson et al reported 74% of patients  were pain-free following urinary diversion and 68% were  satisfied. Eight of the 36 patients (22%) who did not have a  cystectomy at the original surgery went on to undergo cys - tectomy for residual symptoms. 196  Rossberger et al reported  on 47 patients undergoing urinary diversion without cys - tectomy. A secondary cystectomy was performed in 17%  to treat persistent suprapubic pain. 200 Based on these retrospective series, patients with identified  bladder disease, such as those with Hunner’s lesions 199,200   and those with a diminished maximum anesthetic bladder  capacity, 197,201  were more likely to have improvement in pain  and lower urinary tract symptoms postoperatively. Guideline: Based on Level 3 evidence, major surgery with  substitution cystoplasty or urinary diversion ± cystectomy  are options for treatment of IC/BPS in patients refractory  to all other treatment options with significantly impaired  quality of life due to urinary symptoms and pain. Due to the  invasiveness of surgery, the benign nature of IC/BPS, and  multiple other treatment options available, major surgery  should be considered an absolute last resort.  F. Emerging therapies Novel  therapies  are  emerging  for  treatment  of  IC/BPS.  Investigational treatments include hyperbaric oxygen, silden - afil, monoclonal antibodies, cannabinoids, and intravesical  liposomes.  1. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) HBO has been studied in one case series and two small pilot  RCTs. Tanaka et al 202  reported successful outcomes in 7/11  patients treated with HBO over 2 ‒ 4 weeks. Improvements  in pain, urgency, frequency, capacity, and symptom scores  were maintained for up to 12 months (p&lt;0.05 compared to  baseline). Adverse effects included one transient eustachian  tube dysfunction and three cases of otitis media. Gallego- Villar et al 203  and van Ophoven et al 204  both reported small  pilot study RCTs. Van Ophoven et al found 3/14 vs. 0/7  responders in the treatment vs. sham groups respectively  (p&lt;0.05).  Gallego-Villar et al reported success in 10/10 vs.  4/10 patients treated with HBO after DMSO instillations  vs. sham treatment after DMSO, respectively. Duration of  response was 9.3 vs. 3.1 months in the treatment vs. sham  groups (p=0.022). Guideline: Based on Level 2 and 3 evidence (with small  numbers) HBO may be considered in the treatment of IC/ BPS for informed patients refractory to other options. 2. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors  A recent double blind, placebo-controlled RCT compared  sildenafil 25 mg orally once daily (n=24) to placebo (n=24)  in women with non-ulcerative IC/BPS. They found a signifi - cant improvement in symptoms in the treatment vs. placebo  arms (P&lt;0.05). 205  Side effects were minimal and included  flushing and headache.  </p>

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E138 Cox et al. with 87% experiencing levator pain during pelvic examina - tion. 18  Palpation of the levator muscles in both sexes, looking  for tenderness, spasm/tight bands, and/or trigger points, is  important for both diagnosis and treatment recommenda - tions; pelvic floor or rectal spasms may respond well to  pelvic floor physiotherapy. Hypo or hypersensitivity of the  perineum, in combination with a weak or absent anal reflex,  may suggest pudendal nerve entrapment.  A digital rectal examination (DRE) in men is essential,  noting prostate characteristics along with discrete point ten - derness of the prostate and pelvic floor muscles. Prostatic  massage could be considered if pain appears to be more  related to the prostate. Although the diagnosis of IC/BPS  and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men  may overlap, differentiation between prostate-related and  bladder-related pain generation may help advise treatment  strategies. The female pelvic exam should screen for vulvodynia,  vaginitis, atrophic changes, prolapse, cervical pathology,  and adnexal masses or tenderness. Point tenderness, a mass,  and expression of pus on palpation of the urethra are classic  signs of a urethral diverticulum.  3. Ultrasound/pelvic imaging (OPTIONAL, select patients, Grade C,  Level 4 evidence) Abdominal or pelvic ultrasonography, or other imaging  modalities, may be useful when alternative clinical condi - tions are questioned, but are expected to be normal if IC/ BPS is the only diagnosis. The appropriate abdominal/pelvic  imaging should be completed for patients with microscopic  or macroscopic hematuria. 4   4. Frequency volume chart (RECOMMENDED all patients, Grade C,  Level 3 evidence) +/- post-void residual (OPTIONAL, when indicated,  Grade C, Level 4 evidence) A frequency volume chart is advocated to differentiate poly - uria from the classic small voided volumes expected with IC/ BPS. In a study of 47 adult women with IC/BPS, the average  voided volume was less than 100mL. 19  On average, IC/BPS  patients void a volume of urine ranging from 86 ‒ 174mL,  compared to an average of 289 mL in an asymptomatic  woman. The average number of daytime voids ranges from  17 ‒ 25 compared to six. 20,21 A voiding diary also helps to determine the severity of the  storage symptoms and can be used for positive reinforcement  related to behavioural and pharmacological intervention.   When a history of poor emptying is obtained and/or the  bladder is palpable on exam, measurement of a post-void  residual is recommended.  5. Laboratory tests: Urinalysis, culture (RECOMMENDED all patients,  Grade C, Level 4 evidence), cytology (OPTIONAL, when indicated,  Grade C, Level 4 evidence) A urine dipstick represents the minimum required laboratory  test for IC/BPS. Glucose, leukocytes, hematuria, nitrites, and  osmolality may be simply screened for. Absence of leuko - cytes does not rule out IC/BPS. If signs of UTI are identi - fied, a culture and sensitivity is required and possibly test - ing for  Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma,  Corynebacterium  species,  Candida  species, and  Mycoplasma  tuberculosis  if sterile pyuria persists.   Urine cytology is indicated if microscopic hematuria  is identified or if there are other risk factors for urothelial  carcinoma present, such as smoking. Hematuria has been  reported in up to 41% of patients with IC/BPS (only 2/60  were gross hematuria) and none were associated with a  life-threatening urological condition. 22 6. Symptom scores (RECOMMENDED, all patients, Grade C, Level 3  evidence)  Symptom scores for IC/BPS are useful to establish base - line symptom severity and to track response to therapeu - tic intervention. Five self-administered symptom scores for  IC/BPS have been assessed to variable extents, including:   the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI); the Interstitial  Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI); 23  The Wisconsin Interstitial  Cystitis scale (UW-IC scale); 24  the Pain, Urgency, Frequency  score (PUF score); 25  and the Bladder Pain/IC Symptom Score  (BPIC-SS). 26 The UW-IC scale, although well-validated and compre - hensive, has not been adopted in clinical practice. The com - bined ICSI/ICPI (also known as the O’Leary Sant Symptom  and Problem Index) consist of a four-item symptom and  problem index focusing on urgency, frequency, nocturia,  and pain, over the past month. It met standards for variabil - ity, test retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct  validity, as well as responsiveness. 23,27  Further studies have  re-evaluated the instrument in larger series of IC patients. 27-29 The PUF score has not been subject to as extensive a  validation process, but has additional items related to pelvic  pain and dyspareunia. 25  Kushner et al examined the ability of  the PUF score and the ICSI/ICPI to distinguish IC from other  urinary tract pathologies in a group of 220 clinic patients.  All three scales did distinguish IC, and the PUF score (13 or  greater) did so more efficiently. 30 The  BPIC-SS  was  developed  to  address  a  perceived  need to reliably identify IC/BPS patients with moderate to  severe pain, for inclusion in clinical trials. Through inter - viewing patients in various countries, the most common  symptoms described include bladder pain, persistent urge  to  urinate,  and  high  urinary  frequency.  After  analyzing  </p>
                                        
                                            <p>4. CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E139 i C/BPS guideline patients’ responses to questionnaires and testing the ques - tions’ validity, the researchers came up with eight items that  had strong sensitivity and specificity. The authors concluded  that patients with a BPIC-SS score of 19 or greater should  be included in clinical trials. 26 Clinicians must keep in mind that none of the surveys  have sufficient specificity to serve as a sole diagnostic indica - tor, but rather can be used as tools to assist with diagnosis.  Based on current literature, the use of the ICSI, ICPI (or its  updated version, the BPIC-SS) and/or the PUF score to grade  severity of symptoms and follow response to therapeutic  intervention in patients with IC/BPS is recommended.  7. Cystoscopy (RECOMMENDED, all patients, Grade C, Level 3 evidence)  Cystoscopy performed alone, without hydrodistension, is  expected to be normal (except for discomfort and reduced  “functional” bladder capacity) in the majority of patients  with IC/BPS.  Hunner’s ulcers or lesions can be found with  or without hydrodistension under anesthetic in approxi - mately 16%. 31  Hunner’s lesions are associated with more  severe symptoms and reduced urodynamic and anesthetic  capacity. 32,33   The classic findings of terminal hematuria and  glomerulations are reliably identified only after a formal  hydrodistension under anesthetic. However, evidence shows  that glomerulations are neither sensitive nor specific for IC. 34   As such, the purpose of cystoscopy alone should only  be viewed as a tool to rule out bladder cancer/carcinoma  in situ, to identify Hunner’s lesions that reflect severe dis - ease or even different disease (information that may impact  treatment decisions), to determine effect on pelvic pain dur - ing bladder filling and emptying, to objectively evaluate  “functional” bladder capacity, to facilitate appropriate pelvic  examination, and to reassure the patient. The incidence of bladder cancer presenting with symp - toms compatible with IC/BPS is rare. Tissot et al 35  found  1% of 600 patients referred with a diagnosis of IC/BPS had  bladder cancer. Most (5/6) with cancer were older than 60  and all except two had microscopic hematuria or positive  cytology.   Cystoscopy  may  be  considered  optional  in  a  young  woman with symptoms of IC/BPS and no risk factors for  bladder cancer or other pelvic conditions. This may enable  non-urologist physicians to initiate treatment earlier in the  stage of disease, when it is potentially more effective. 36  It is  reasonable to recommend cystoscopy to assist in making a  diagnosis before initiating therapy, especially if there is any  indication on history, physical examination, urinalysis, or  cytology suggesting that other diseases need to be ruled out.  Identification of Hunner’s lesions and pelvic floor muscle  dysfunction (pelvic floor examination is easily added to a  cystoscopic examination) will direct treatment strategies. 8. Potassium sensitivity test (NOT RECOMMENDED, Grade C, Level 3  evidence) A potassium chloride bladder permeability test was based  on the assumption that a “dysfunctional epithelium” (glycos - aminoglycan [GAG] layer) 37  allowed potassium ions to cross  the abnormally permeable urothelium, depolarize nerves and  muscles, and result in pain. The technique comparing subjec - tive pain or urgency responses to intravesically instilled 0.4  M potassium chloride vs. water was described by Parsons et  al, 37  but has been modified by other authors, including vari - ants such as the comparative cystometrogram test. 38    This test could potentially direct therapy if a positive  potassium sensitivity test correlated well with a favourable  response to agents that attempt to replenish the GAG layer,  as has been suggested in two small series. 39,40  However, in  a phase 4 dosing study for pentosan polysulfate (PPS), an  epithelial-directed therapy, no difference in response to PPS  was observed. 41,42 The sensitivity and specificity of the potassium sensitiv - ity test (69.5% and 50%) were found by Chambers et al to  be poor, adding no additional use over history and cystos - copy. 43   Others have found that the potassium sensitivity test  did not correlate with either cystoscopic findings or bladder  capacity on urodynamics. 43   Further   confounding the diag - nosis in symptomatic patients, 25% with OAB (almost all  with radiation and IC) and 50 ‒ 84% with chronic pelvic pain  syndrome (CPPS) test positive. 37,44   In asymptomatic men, a  36% false-positive rate was found. 45 At this point, the use of the potassium sensitivity test has  not been widely validated and the ability of this test to pre - dict efficacy with GAG-replenishing therapies is not reliable.  It is a costly and painful test, with patients experiencing pain  both during and after the procedure. For these reasons, the  potassium sensitivity test is no longer recommended as a  standard evaluation for IC/BPS. 9. Intravesical anesthetic bladder challenge (OPTIONAL, select patients,  Grade C, Level 3 evidence)   An anesthetic challenge test, such as an alkalized lidocaine  test, instills 10 ‒ 20 mL of an anesthetic mixture (in this case,  200 mg lidocaine mixed with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate)  into an empty bladder. This fluid is held for 10 ‒ 15 min - utes and then drained by catheter. This test can easily be  performed after cystoscopy and can provide both relief to  the patient, as well as provide diagnostic information and  guide future therapy. A patient experiencing relief from  the instillation would provide more certainty that the pain  is originating from the bladder. Resolution of the pain by  intravesical local anesthesia can be both diagnostic and  therapeutic. 46   </p>

Stress management techniques and psychological support (RECOMMENDED  in patients identified with suffering from stress or psychological dysfunction,  Grade B) Because of its chronic nature, the psychological impact of  IC/BPS on the patient’s quality of life should be specific - ally addressed as an integral part of treatment. A significant  number of patients with IC/BPS have reported experien - cing depression, anxiety, distress, and various degrees of  disability. 67  The physician-patient relationship should be  emotionally supportive. 62  As stress is known to exacerbate  symptoms, 68  stress-reduction strategies, such as exercising,  bathing, reducing working hours, meditation, yoga, and  guided imagery 62,69  can be beneficial.  Sexual dysfunction should be addressed, as it may worsen  IC/BPS symptoms. 70  However, treatment of female sexual  dysfunction (FSD) is challenging. Management strategies  might include counselling, physiotherapy, complementary  medications, pharmacologic treatments (hormonal and non- hormonal), or even surgical options. 70  Detailed management  strategies for FSD are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Guideline: Based on a large body of literature and the lack of  side effects, conservative therapies, including patient educa - tion, dietary modifications, bladder retraining,and stress man - agement are recommended as first-line treatment for IC/BPS. B. Physical therapy techniques 1.

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E145 i C/BPS guideline Unfortunately, the study was halted prematurely, but the  interim  results  on  56  patients  showed  no  difference  in  response between treatment and placebo groups (15% vs.  16%, p=0.67). 100 Guideline: Based on Level 3 evidence, CyA may be consid - ered a treatment option for IC/BPS. Close patient moni - toring, including blood pressure, Cr and CyA levels are  necessary. Due to the potential for serious side effects, CyA  should be reserved for severe patients refractory to other  treatment options.  6. Gabapentinoids (OPTION in patients with neuropathic pain, Grade C) Based on success in treating other neuropathic pain condi - tions, gabapentin has been used for the treatment of IC/BPS.  Only two case reports 101,102  and three small observational  trials exist 103-105  The only trial that used gabapentin alone  found a 48% improvement in pelvic pain. 105 Guideline: Based on scarce Level 3 evidence, gabapentin  may be an option in the treatment of IC/BPS refractory to  conservative therapies.   7. Quercetin (OPTION, Grade C) Quercetin has been used to treat male chronic pelvic pain  syndrome with success. 106  One small observational trial has  found a symptomatic improvement in 19/22 patients with  IC/BPS after four weeks of Cysta-Q complex (equivalent to  quercetin 500 mg orally twice daily). 107   Guideline: Based on scarce Level 3 evidence, quercetin may  be an option in the treatment of IC/BPS. C2. Intravesical therapies Multiple agents have been studied, alone or in combination,  for instillation into the bladder for treatment of IC/BPS. Table  3 summarizes various cocktails described in the literature.  Treatments may be administered in the clinic setting or at  home in some cases. Common side effects include tem - porary discomfort, hematuria, and UTI. The use of an 8 Fr  pediatric feeding tube combined with intraurethral lidocaine  may help to improve tolerance to the procedure. 108 1. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (RECOMMENDED in select patients, Grade B) DMSO is an organic solvent with anti-inflammatory and  analgesic properties. Theoretically, it may cause dissolution  of collagen that could potentially cause bladder fibrosis if  used on a long-term basis. 109  The strongest data supporting  its use come from five small RCTs. Perez-Marrero et al com - pared  DMSO  to  normal  saline  (NS)  and  showed  a  93%  objective improvement and 53% subjective improvement  compared to 35% and 18%, respectively, in controls. 110   Two RCTs compared DMSO to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin  (BCG), one favouring DMSO (30% response rate compared  to 10% for BCG, p&lt;0.05) 111  and one concluding no benefit  with either regimen. 112  Finally, two other RCTs compared  DMSO to chondroitin sulfate (CS), or to CS plus hyaluronic  acid, with significantly better performances of CS groups  over DMSO for both objective and subjective outcomes  (14 ‒ 53 % for DMSO against 73% for GAG, p&lt;0.05). 113,114   Other observational studies have described use of DMSO in  combination with corticoids, bicarbonate, or heparin. 52,115-117   Overall, DMSO has a favourable safety profile. Typical  side effects include halitosis (garlic-like breath, as it is elim - inated through the lungs) and potential flare-up after the first  instillation, which usually improves after the second one. 118   It is administered as a 50 mL solution of 50% DMSO with  a dwell time of 30 ‒ 60 minutes, once weekly for six weeks.  Monthly maintenance doses may be considered. 119 Guideline: Based on Level 2 evidence, DMSO is a thera - peutic option for IC/BPS. 2. Heparin (RECOMMENDED in select patients, Grade C) Heparin, as a GAG analogue, may be instilled intravesically  with virtually no systemic absorption. It may be used alone  by mixing 20 000 to 40 000 IU of heparin diluted in 10 mL  NS on a weekly basis for four to six weeks 118  and retained for  30 ‒ 60 minutes. From two prospective, uncontrolled studies,  Table 3.

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E146 Cox et al. heparin as the sole instillation component provided symp - tom improvement for 56 ‒ 73% of patients at three months  with few adverse events reported. 120,121  Nowadays, it is most  often used within various cocktails (Table 3), mixed with  lidocaine, bicarbonate, or other components, making com - parisons between studies difficult. Combined with DMSO,  it reduced and deferred relapses compared to DMSO alone,  for 32% of patients. 122  Combined with lidocaine and sodium  bicarbonate, three observational studies reported success - ful outcome for 65 ‒ 94% of patients at two to four weeks  after the last instillation. 120,123,124  Lastly, in a multicentre,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, Parsons  et al showed that a combination of alkalinized lidocaine  and heparin provided up to 12 hours of relief from urgency  and pain for 42% of patients. 125 Guideline: Based on Level 3 evidence, intravesical heparin,  alone or in combination, is a therapeutic option for IC/BPS. 3. Hyaluronic acid (HA) (OPTION, Grade C) HA is thought to help improve or recreate the defective blad - der GAG layer in IC/BPS. Several observational studies have  reported a wide range of response rates, from 30 ‒ 87%. 39,126- 134  Combination therapy with HA and chondroitin sulfate has  also shown encouraging results up to three years in small  cohorts of patients. 135-137   However, the efficacy of intravesical HA has been ques - tioned  in  three  reported,  but  unpublished  RCTs,  which  found no significant symptom improvement compared to  placebo. 138-140  Few adverse reactions have been reported  except for mild irritative symptoms.  Guideline: Based on published Level 3 evidence, intravesi - cal HA may be considered part of multimodal therapy for  IC/BPS. However, it should be kept in mind that three nega - tive trials have been completed without published results.  4. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) (OPTION, Grade D) In theory, treatment with CS may help replenish the GAG  layer of the bladder. A number of small, uncontrolled, sin - gle-centre studies have suggested that intravesical CS may  ameliorate symptoms in some IC/BPS patients 141-143  and a  recent prospective, multicentre “real-life” clinical trial fur - ther confirmed the potential benefits of this treatment. 144   Two underpowered RCTs gathering 163 patients have been  recently reported with a tendency for favourable responses  with CS compared to placebo (38 ‒ 39% vs. 23 ‒ 31%), 145,146   but the magnitude of benefit observed could not support  its use as a monotherapy of IC/BPS. A higher-power meta- analysis of all patients treated in these studies showed benefit  over placebo, but like all intravesical therapies, the magni - tude of benefit suggests it should be used only as part of a  planned multimodal treatment strategy. 147  In a head-to-head  small RCT of 15 patients, a low concentration preparation of  CS obtained only 17% treatment satisfaction rate compared  to 63% with HA. 147 Guideline: CS should not be used as monotherapy, but may  be considered as part of multimodal therapy for IC/BPS. 5. Lidocaine (RECOMMENDED in select patients, Grade B) Intravesical lidocaine is better absorbed from the human  bladder  when  alkalinized  with  sodium  bicarbonate. 148   Several observational studies have reported therapeutic  potential in treatment of acute flares of IC/BPS. 120,148,149  In  a phase 2 multicentre RCT of 102 patients, Nickel et al  reported significant improvement in symptoms compared  to placebo after a five-day course of buffered lidocaine  three days after last instillation (30% vs. 10%, p=0.012),  which was no longer statistically significant at 10 days (24%  vs. 12%, p=0.102). 150  Electromotive drug administration  (EMDA), a modality used to enhance drug absorption by  the urothelium through active transport, and the lidocaine- releasing intravesical system (LiRIS), a controlled-release  device that prolongs dwell time, have also been recently  attempted. 151,152   Guideline: Instillation on a daily or weekly basis of alka - linized lidocaine is an option for short-term relief IC/BPS  symptoms, primarily bladder pain, based on Level 2 evi - dence. 6. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) (NOT RECOMMENDED, Grade B) RTX is a potent analogue of the chili pepper extract capsai - cin, 153  a neurotoxin that desensitizes C-fiber afferent neurons  that transmit pain and, thus, could alleviate pain in IC/BPS. 154   In a systematic review, Mourtzoukou et al concluded that  results from the six studies currently available (three RCTs,  two prospective studies, and one case series) are contra - dictory regarding the effectiveness of RTX. 155  With import - ant tolerability issues, primarily pain following instillation,  data are currently insufficient to make a conclusion on its  therapeutic efficacy in IC/BPS. Guideline: Based on conflicting Level 2 evidence and the  adverse side effect profile, RTX is not recommended for  treatment of IC/BPS. 7. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (NOT RECOMMENDED, Grade B) BCG instilled into the bladder to stimulate an immunologic  response and attenuate symptoms of IC/BPS has been stud - ied. BCG was tested in a large RCT of 265 patients with a  response rate of 21% (vs. 12% for placebo, p=0.062). 156   Another prospective trial of 30 patients followed for a mean  of eight months showed a success rate of 60% compared  to 27% for placebo, but did not reach statistical signifi - </p>

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E149 i C/BPS guideline Guideline:  Based  on  minimal  Level  2  evidence,  PDE-5  inhibitors may be considered for the treatment of informed  patients with IC/BPS. 3. Monoclonal antibodies against TNF-alpha Adalimumab,  an  anti-tumour  necrosis  factor-alpha,  has  been studied for IC/BPS in a Phase 3 RCT. Adalimumab  failed to demonstrate positive proof of concept compared  to placebo due to a significant placebo effect. 206  Intravenous  tanezumab, an anti-nerve growth factor, demonstrated a  statistically significant decrease in daily pain score and  improvement in global response assessment in a Phase 2  RCT. 207  A meta-analysis of all female patients diagnosed with  urologic CPPS showed a significant benefit with tanezumab  treatment compared to placebo. Guideline: Monoclonal antibodies are not available or rec - ommended for IC/BPS at this point, but further studies are  needed. 4. Cannabinoids Cannabinoid analgesia is reported for the management of dif - ficult-to-treat pain from chronic illnesses. 208,209  Cannabinoids  may reduce pain through various interactions with neuro - transmitter systems and also have anti-inflammatory and  immunomodulatory properties. 210  For IC/BPS, only animal  studies and case reports are available 211-213  but it appears a  promising avenue and future studies are needed to assess  its efficacy and safety. Guideline: Use of cannabinoid analgesia is not recom - mended for IC/BPS at this point, but further studies are  needed. 5. Intravesical liposomes  Intravesical liposomes, vesicles of phospholipid bilayers,  may serve as a “lotion” for wounded bladder mucosa. 214   With an approximately 50% response rate in two observa - tional studies, 214,215  it remains investigational, but appears  promising for symptomatic flare-ups. 215 Guideline:  Use  of  intravesical  liposomes  is  not  recom - mended for IC/BPS at this point, but further studies are  needed. G. Phenotype-directed multimodal therapy (RECOMMENDED for all  patients, Grade B) IC/BPS is a heterogeneous condition challenging to treat  for clinicians, with no treatment that is successful for all  patients. Patients can be identified with characteristic pheno - typic patterns based on proposed mechanisms and symptom  complexes and, hopefully in the future, biomarkers. One  such categorization of this heterogenous group of patients  is the UPOINT phenotypic classification system, which has  been described to characterize patients with IC/BPS and  guide potential therapies. 46,216  Recently, it has been applied  as a treatment approach in a prospective, observational trial  of 100 patients. At 18.3 months mean followup, a major  clinical improvement above baseline was found in 26.9%  and a significant improvement in 47.2%; however, it was  noted that almost all patients were satisfied with the thera - peutic approach. 216   A  rationale  treatment  strategy  would  be  to  clinically  characterize individual patients in regard to symptoms and  possible mechanisms and then direct the most appropriate  therapy to each of the phenotypic domains.   Conclusion  In conclusion, multiple options exist for the treatment of  IC/BPS, ranging from conservative therapies with few side  effects to major abdominal surgery. Table 4 outlines the  available treatment options based on the data summarized  for the purpose of this guideline. An attempt by the consen - sus panel to identify (when possible) the optimal therapy for  each patient has been made. It is the panel’s expert opin - ion that the traditional and structured tiered monotherapy  approach is not the optimal therapeutic strategy. An indi - vidualized treatment plan, directed towards that patient’s  unique clinical phenotype, based on the recommended  diagnostic algorithm, will lead to the best outcomes. 216 Competing interests:  Dr. Cox is has been an Advisory Board member for Asetllas and Ferring; has  received grants/honoraria from Astellas and Pfizer; and has participated in clinical trials for Aquinox.

CUAJ • May-June 2016 • Volume 10, Issues 5-6 E147 i C/BPS guideline cance (p=0.06). 157  In a prospective study of 21 patients with  a crossover design, the authors failed to demonstrate any  benefit from BCG over DMSO. 112 Guideline: Based on Level 2 evidence showing no signifi - cant improvement in symptoms and the adverse side effect  profile, BCG is not recommended for treatment of IC/BPS  8. Intravesical pentosan polysulfate (PPS) (OPTION, Grade C) The rationale for intravesical use of PPS, a weak analogue of  heparin that may replenish the deficient GAG layer, is that only  1 ‒ 3% of oral PPS reaches the bladder. It was tested in two  small RCTs. Bade et al observed improvement in symptoms  for 40% of patients compared to placebo, with rare hematuria  reported as the only adverse event. 158  Davis et al obtained a  62% response rate at Week 18 for patients treated with both  oral and intravesical PPS compared to oral PPS and intravesical  NS, with no significant differences in adverse events between  treatment groups. 159  Finally, in an open-label, uncontrolled  study, intravesical PPS encapsulated into liposomes showed  efficacy and safety in eight patients over three months. 160 Guideline: Based on Level 2 evidence, intravesical PPS,  alone or in combination with oral PPS, is a treatment option  for IC/BPS. 9. Intravesical oxybutynin (OPTION, Grade C) In one small RCT, Barbalias et al showed efficacy of intra - vesical oxybutynin and bladder training compared to bladder  training alone (with saline bladder instillations) in improving  bladder capacity, frequency, and quality of life scores. 161   No adverse events were reported. Intravesical oxybutynin is  well-tolerated and has both anticholinergic and anaesthetic  properties on the bladder wall. 162 Guideline: Based on scarce Level 2 evidence and a favour - able side effect profile, intravesical oxybutynin is an option  for treatment of IC/BPS.

Hydrodistension (HD) (OPTION, Grade C) Despite the lack of randomized data to support the use of  low-pressure, short-duration HD, it remains one of the most  commonly used treatments for IC/BPS. 163  Observational stud - ies have shown efficacy rates ranging from 30 ‒ 54% at one  month; 18 ‒ 56% at two to three months; and 0 ‒ 37% at five  to six months. 19,164,165 There is a lack of standardized protocol throughout stud - ies. Complications of HD include flare of symptoms (9%), 19   bladder rupture, 166  and bladder necrosis. 167  Prolonged HD,  where the bladder is distended with a balloon from minutes  to hours, should be discouraged due to a high complication  rate of 20%. 153  The long-term complication rate of repeated  HD is unknown. Guideline: Based on Level 3 evidence, short-duration, low- pressure HD is a treatment option for IC/BPS. 2. Treatment of Hunner’s lesions (RECOMMENDED for patients with identified  Hunner’s lesions, Grade B) Several case series have reported various endourologic treat - ments for Hunner’s lesions. Transurethral resection of Hunner’s  lesions with a loop cautery was first described in 1971. 168  In  the largest series reported by Peeker et al ,  90% of 103 patients  had symptomatic relief following resection, which lasted  more than three years for 40% of patients. 169  Fulguration with  a Bugbee electrode is another option that led to symptom - atic improvement in 76 ‒ 90% of 150 cases described. 170-173   Transurethral coagulation using neodymium:yttrium-alum - inum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, has been reported in two small  observational series with short-term improvements of 78%  and 100%. 174,175  To prevent bladder or bowel perforation,  low bladder filling volume and low-power setting (10 ‒ 15 W),  firing during 1 ‒ 3 seconds in constant motion until the ulcer  is blanched, are recommended. 174  Cox et al described direct  injection of triamcinolone into the ulcers in 30 patients. They  showed a significant improvement for 70%, with a lasting  response between 7 and 12 months. 176   Complications of these procedures include bladder per - foration, hemorrhage, bowel injury, 175  and bladder fibro - sis. 169,172  Lesions tend to recur and retreatment will likely be  necessary over time. 169,171 Guideline: Based on consistent Level 3 evidence, endo - scopic treatment of Hunner’s lesions is recommended for  IC/BPS patients with Hunner’s lesions.   3. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) (OPTION, Grade C) Multiple  small  observational  studies  have  consistently  shown a significant improvement in pain, urinary symp - toms, and quality of life with intravesical BTX-A. 177-181  Two  small, double-blind RCTs have been conducted. Manning et  al found no significant overall difference between patients  randomized to HD plus NS injection vs. HD plus 500 U  Dysport ® . 182  However, Kuo et al reported a 72% vs. 48%  success rate in patients randomized to Botox ®   (100 or 200  U) plus HD vs. HD alone (p=0.032) at three months. 100 U  appear to be as effective as 200 U with fewer side effects. 183   Unfortunately, it is difficult to comment on the effect of  BTX-A alone, as all groups included HD.  The safety and efficacy of repeat BTX-A injections has  been shown in observational studies. 184-187  The duration  (approximately 9 ‒ 10 months) 186  and strength of response  seem to be maintained with repeat injections and rate of  adverse events low.  </p>
