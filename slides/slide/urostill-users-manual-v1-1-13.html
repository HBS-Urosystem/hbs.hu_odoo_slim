It depends on the type of the syringe which is used for self - instillation.   -   Pre - filled syringes are in ready - to - use state:  apart from unpacking you need do nothing.    -   Empty  syringes  should  be  filled  up.  Consult  the  instructions  received  from  your  therapist and/or pharmacist.    -   In case of a 20ml syringe the constrictor ring should be placed in the holder.    -   In case of a 50ml syringe the constrictor ring should be removed  from the holder.    -   In  case  of  a  pre - filled  syringe  which  is  packed  as  two  separate  parts,  for  assembling  them follow the manual provided by your manufacturer and/or distributor.      6.8   Put the syringe into the holder and fix its position with the flip lock.

Approach the orifice with the  UroDapter ® .    7.6   These  events  can  be  followed  on  the  display.  Watch  the  screen  for  navigating  UroDapter ® .      Figure - 2 2 : Approaching the orifice. External view (A) and the image  recorded by the camera  appearing on the display (B).      If you are performing self - instillation for the first time,  be  sure that you can navigate the Self - Instillator   safely and effectively.   7.7   Insert the tip of  UroDapter ®   into your orifice. Apply some pressure so that the isolating  collar   can  be  pushed  against  the  nearby  tissues,  which  prevents  the  leakage  of  the  instilled  solution.  (The  tip  of  UroDapter ®   penetrates  the  urethra  only  in  a  length  of  approximately 6mm. )    7.8   Start instilling the solution by pressing the plunger of the syringe.

UroStill®  USER’S MANUAL     19       Notice   If you have checked earlier that the camera, the display and  the  application  you  use  are  compatible,  the  following  actions  (in  that  order)  resolve  the  situatio n  if  you  cannot  see the image recorded by the camera on the display.   -   Check whether the illumination is sufficient   -   Check whether the camera is connected correctly    -   Restart the application   -   If there is still no change, restart the display      6.13   Check the quality of the image on   the display.        Notice   In the majority of the cases blurred image is a result of  the inappropriate illumination. Whenever it is possible  adjust not only the LED lights but also the external  illumination, too, so that the  area of the self - treatment  should be neither too bright, n or too dark.      If needed ,   the power of the LED lights can be adjusted with the knob on the side of the  connection of the camera.       Figure - 20 : The power of LED lights can be adjusted with the knob (framed)   6.14   Rotate the syringe gently in the holder until the image of UroDapter ®   appears on   the screen.

If  the  camera  has  been  connected,  the  image  it  is  recording appears on   the screen instead of the picture  shown above   On the main screen the following icons can be found.   If it is not stated otherwise, you can  close any menu by touching its icon again.   (1)     Setup.  You can adjust aspect ratio and the timing of recording here. You can also  check the software specifi cations.  Using this menu is not needed for the self - treatment.      Notice   In case of certain displays ,   the appearing image might be  distorted, with black stripes on the sides. By pressing the  first icon of this menu (to the left) two other icons appear.  Press the left one, then press the arrow in the top left corner  twice. With these actions you can set th e aspect ratio back  to normal.     (2)   Flipping and rotating. The icons appearing stand for the following functions: vertical  mirroring, horizontal mirroring, rotating  180 °, rotating 90° counter - clockwise, rotating  90°clockwise.   Use any of these icons if you face difficulties at navigating with UroStill ®     (3)   Searching for connected cameras.   If you use the option display, the image recorded by the camera appears on the display as  soon as OTG View is started. In this case, you do not have to use this icon.    If you use a different display, you might touch this icon once so that the image can app ear.      Notice   If  you  use  a  different  electronic  displaying  system  to  the  options,  it  is  possible  that  OTG  View  cannot  detect  the  camera.   In   this   case,   try   to   download   a   different  application.  Google  Play  offers  several  free  applications  for using endoscope   cameras.

The following illustrations show the parts of the disposables which are in contact with the  urethra, its surroundings, and/or the solution being instilled during the self - treatment.  Regarding maintaining sterility these are the areas must be focused   on. All the other parts can  be touched with clean hands or placed on clean surfaces without any health risk.     Figure - 6. In case of the tap and the extension sterility must be maintained at the areas where the  solution which is being instilled flows  through   (framed) . Both of the elements can be placed on any  level surface  without  the parts described contact with the surface itself. (Safety caps are not shown  in the picture.)     Figure - 7.  Regarding  UroDapter ®   the  tip  and  the  isolating  collar  (left),  and  the  part  where  the  solution flows in (right) must remain sterile. Remove the adapter from its packaging only before it  is being used.  Putting back  UroDapter ®   into its packaging while following the steps of asse mbling  UroStill ®   is the best way to maintain its sterility.  The safest way to use UroDapter ®   is to grab its  think, ribbed part (in the middle).     6.   Assembling UroStill ®       This  chapter  exp l ains  how  to  assemble  the  Self - Instillator.  We  recommend  you  follow  the  sequence written here.  In case you find it more comfortable, certain steps can be swapped. Even  if you do so, maintain sterility to the highest possible extent.    If you are not using any display for the self - instillation, skip steps  6.1 – 6.3.   </p>

However, the design  UroStill ®  enables the use of a camera as an option  so that the patient can perform the self - treatment more easily and safely, without the need of  any extensional help.  UroStill ®  can be used together with our options (whic h can be purchased  from the manufacturer or the distributor) just as well as with other displaying systems (camera,  smart - device or mirror).   Our options consist of the following items.   4.8   –   Endoscopic camera with LED light sources; on its  1 - meter   long cable a  switch can  be found with which brightness can be adjusted gradually (henceforth: camera), 1  pc.    </p>

If the guide and the instructions, orders and/or suggestions of your therapist contradict  each other,  always take the latter into account!      4.1 Identifying and Exposing the   Orifice of the Urethra     Regarding the size and the exact location of the labia the anatomy of the female external  reproductive organs are of high diversity.   It is important to know that the fingers used for exposition should lie as close to the orifice as   they can be. The exposition has to happen by pulling the labia apart laterally (and not only  upwards).   In many cases the wrinkles located at the edge of the orifice (the pseudolabia) are entirely  clenched, which makes the identification of the opening har d. It is worth wiping the area with  some antiseptic solution. The piece of gauze used for this process  –   if it is being moved  slowly and downwards  –   can part the pseudolabia for a short time. The location of the orifice  can be identified easily afterwards.     After UroDapter ®   has been put into the orifice, move the orifice a bit downwards, closer to  the rectum ,  with your fingers used for exposing the orifice . Perform a gentle “spooning” move  with the adapter downwards   to move the orifice under your symphysis  –   the  isolating collar  of  UroDapter ®   helps.      4.2 Finding the Best Angle f or   the Syringe     The optimal instillation (when the least resistance can be experienced) can be performed if the  axis of the urethra and the  syringe are parallel.    After the orifice has been driven under the symphysis with the „spooning” described before,  the best angle for the instillation is the horizontal one  –   in most of the cases.   Your anatomy must be focused on, too.    In case of younger p atients, the tissues situated nearby are tight. When UroDapter ®   is situated  slightly upwards (its tip is slightly above its other end), the instillation can be performed with  the most efficiency.    Older patients’ tissues are significantly looser (they are  particularly „sloppy” after a  considerable weight loss). In this case, the urethra is orientated downwards, therefore the  angle of the instillation should follow it: the adapter should be situated slightly from up to  down (approximately 20 – 40 degrees).   Whe n the optimal angle has been found the instillation becomes suddenly easier. Since the  sealing collar is flexible, the treatment can be done safely even if the syringe is not  perpendicular to the orifice.   </p>
                                        
                                            <p>22. UroStill®  USER’S MANUAL     22       Caution !   Always check  whether the solution is being instilled into  the urethra, not into the vagina!   Instilling medicines or medicinal compositions used for the  bladder  treatment  into  the  vagina  is  not  dangerous,  but  makes  the  self - treatment  ineffective,  since  the  solution  does   not reach its target, the bladder.    „Mis - instillation” sometimes can be seen only after the  self - treatment; when the solution flows out of the vagina.     The plunger of certain 50ml syringes are multi - rimmed . By holding the  body of the syringe in  one hand  the instillation can be done easily by pressing the plunger down by the  rims  slowly,  one by one.      Figure - 2 4 : Even if  50ml   syringes are bigger, it is easy to perform the instillation with them, since  with the thumb the  rims  of the plunger can be pushed down in more steps, one by one   7.9   If  you experience any leakage, pause the instillation and check whether the position of  UroDap ter ®   is correct .     Notice   Too  high  and  too  low  pressure  can  cause  leakage,  too.  When  the  plunger  of  the  syringe  is  moving  easily,  with  little - to - no resistance, the applied pressure is  ideal.     7.10   If you use one single solution for the self - treatment or if you have instilled the last  solution,  try  to  hold  back  your  urine  for  at  least  3  hours,  so  that  the  medicine  or  medicinal composition can  affect your bladder (and your urethra) for an ample amount   of time.    7.11   If you use more than one solution (packed in separate syringes), follow the next steps:    -   After finishing the first instillation remove the disposables (the tap, the extension and  UroDapter ® )  from  the  syringe  and  place  it  on  a  level  surface.

In this case, UroDapter ®   appears in the middle of the screen on the display. (To the left: external view, to the right: the image  on   the display)      6.15   If UroDapter ®   does appear on the display but its position is wrong (e.g. upside  down),  loosen  the  screw  of  the  camera  and  rotate  the  camera  until  UroDapter ®   becomes  shown  in  the  bottom  of  the  picture.  Fix  the  camera  once  more  with  the  screw.      Notice   The application OTG View (recommendation) enables  the  conversion  of  the  image  recorded  by  the  camera,  e.g.  rotating  and  mirroring.  Using  these  features  may  make  self - instillation easier.        7.   Performing the Self - Treatment with  UroStill ®     7.1   Find a comfortable posture for the self - treatment.    7.2   Open up your labia with one hand so as to expose the orifice of the urethra.    7.3   Disinfect  the  affected  area  with  your  other  hand.  For  this  procedure  any  mucosal  antiseptic product can be used.        Warning !   Not only the orifice, but its 3cm area and the inner surface  of the labia have to be disinfected.   In  case  of  inadequate  disinfection ,   the  tip  of  UroDapter ®   might  drift  some  bacteria  into  the  urethra .  The  instilled  solution  might  drive  them  into  the  bladder,  which  might  lead to infections.      7.4   Disinfect  the  upper  part  of  the  UroDapter ® ,  including  the  tip  and  the  isolating  collar.  Not only does this prevent bacteria drifting into the urethra, but also it kills the bacteria  present on the outmost part (a couple of millimeters) of the urethra.    </p>
                                        
                                            <p>33. UroStill®  USER’S MANUAL     33       4.3 Leakage Prevention      One of the most common is sues is leakage. If it happens ,   a part of the solution does not reach  the urethra, it flows away instead. In some cases, it can be observed instantly. However, the  leaking solution might enter the vagina  –   which is in a downwards position during the  instil lation  – , and it re - appears only after the instillation has ended and  you have  stood up.  Solutions used for bladder instillation do not cause pain nor complications in the vagina, but  the liquid coming out of that organ might  be frightening  even  if its amount is not more than a  few drops.    During the instillation proper lighting and the constant observation of the sealing collar are  essential so that leakage can be noticed immediately and it can be ceased by certain minor  corrections.   Leakage can  occur when the adapter is not pressed properly against the orifice. If there is not  enough pressure, the collar cannot cover the nearby tissues properly and the opening remains  „unplugged”. By applying more pressure, the flexible collar can adapt itself to   the surface of  the nearby tissues and the orifice will be sealed properly.    Two much pressure can cause leakage, too. In this case the urethra  –   which is already  squeezed longitudinally  –   may bulge. This is called kinking. The intra - urethral pressure  incr eases and exceeds the sealing pressure of the collar. If this happens the applied pressure  has to be decreased gradually. When the resistance of the plunger of the syringe suddenly  disappears, the urethra is in the right condition for the instillation.      4 .4 The Speed of Instillation     Given that the isolating collar is covering the orifice properly, the instilled solution raises the  intra - urethral pressure, which opens the sphincter, thus the solution enters the bladder. That  said, the instillation itself c an be performed in one minute. The exact time, obviously, depends  on multiple factors.   If the sphincter becomes constricted due to pain or fear and muscle tone increases, the  pressure in the urethra increases, which can lead to more pain and the spasmodic  contraction  of the sphincter. If this happens, try to relax. A couple of deep sighs may help, too. Feel free  to slow the instillation down or paus e   it until the constrictions end.      4.5  Special Cases   It is possible to use UroStill ®   during your period, too. Before the self - treatment insert a new  tampon in your vagina. Disinfection of the affected areas must be performed especially  carefully.   (See 7.3 of the User’s Manual.)   Since the tampon applies some pressure from  outside on the ur ethra, the sealing collar must be pushed against the orifice with a larger force  and the plunger of the syringe must be pushed harder, too. On the other hand, kinking (which  was described earlier) rarely occurs because the tampon „ensures the way” for the  instillation.   </p>
                                        
                                            <p>10. UroStill®  USER’S MANUAL     10             Figure - 5.  Uro Still ®   can  be  used  with  several  types  of  syringes.  From  left  to  right:  20ml  syringe  (empty), 20ml prefilled syringes (in their sterile packaging), 50ml syringe (empty)     5.   Directions and Suggestions Before  Performing Self - Instillation     Whenever it is possible, try to perform the self - treatment in calm circumstances. Try to be alone,  or with the only person who gives you help in the treatment. If it is possible, have any children  in your household supervised  by other persons.    Depending on your experience and anatomy self - treatment takes 15...30 minutes long.       5.1   Void before starting the treatment,  empty   your bladder totally.    5.2   Make it sure that you are able to perform the self - instillation in a comfortable  posture.      Notice   For most people the most comfortable position for the self - treatment is lying on her back with legs slightly pulled up.  Self - instillation  can  be  performed  in   other  positions,  too,  providing  it  is  n either   tiring,  nor  uncomfortable,  and  it  enables the proper exposition of the urethra.     5.3   During the treatment  –   especially while the solution is being instilled  –   try to  be fully relaxed. This makes the sphincter rel axed as well, which lowers the  pressure building up in the urethra.   5.4   Take out all the elements you need for the self - treatment and place them within  reach.    5.5   Maintain the sterility of the disposables to the largest possible extent.

UroStill®  USER’S MANUAL     26       Appendix 1  –   Options’ Guide: The Camera and the Tablet      The  following  section  provides  information  on  the  camera  and  the  tablet  we  recommend  as  options.  UroStill ® , however, can be used with any other displaying systems, too.   This summary does not  replace the original documents of any product.     1.1   The display should be used with a fully charged battery whenever it is possible to avoid any  issues  regarding imaging and/or recording.    1.2   In  case  of  using  a  non - waterproof  camera  and/or  display,  keep  these  devices  off  any  moisture to avoid damage. Waterproo f products  have  special  signs and certificates that refer to  this specification.   1.3   Keep the display off the solution being instilled, otherwise it might damage the device.    1.4   The cables of the camera and the charger must not be broken or damaged. Using a damaged  cable might result in  malfunctions of the Self - Instillator or electric shock.    1.5   Damaged electronic devices can be repaired only by professionals. Do not try to repair them  at home.    1.6   During the self - treatment neither the camera nor the cable contact the skin or the mucosa.  They do not penetrate any  body part  either.      Caution !   Do  not  put  the  camera  or  its  cable  into  any  body  part.  Providing  the  device  is  intact ,   it  will  not  cause  electric  shock.  However ,  these  elements  are  not  sterile  so  any  contact  between  them  and  the  mucosa  or  open  wounds  might cause infections.     1.7   During  operation  the  LED  lights  of  the  camera  generate  mild  heat.  Therefore,  prolonged  use m ay make the camera warm, but  this amount of heat will not result in the risk burn or fire.    1.8   If the camera becomes  exceptionally warm during the self - treatment (touching it with hand  is unpleasant), that refers to the malfunction of the device. By following the User’s Manual  neither the camera nor its lead lights get so close to any body surface that they can cause bur n.  However,  if  the  object  touches  the  mucosa  –   which,  depending  on  your  condition  may  be  wounded  or  inflamed  – ,  it  can  cause  minor  burn.  In  conclusion,  do  not  use  the  camera  if  it  becomes hot during its operation.    1.9  Similarly   to  any  other  electronic  dev ice,  the  camera  and  the  display  emit  radiation.  The  gauge of this radiation  mean s   no risk of health.  It might, on the other hand interfere with other  electronic devices, which might result in malfunctions.
