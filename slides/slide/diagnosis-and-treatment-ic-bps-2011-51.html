Please  see Statement 14 on pain management for a  thorough discussion of pain management.       Guideline Statement 9.       The IC/BPS diagnosis should be reconsid- ered if no improvement occurs after multi- ple treatment approaches.  Clinical Princi- ple       Discussion.  If clinically - meaningful trials of  multiple therapies have been conducted with- out efficacy, then the clinician should revisit  the diagnosis of IC/BPS and consider whether  an unidentified disorder may be present that is  producing symptoms. This consideration may  require additional diagnostic workup and/or re- ferral to appropriate specialists.     Treatment Levels for IC/BPS.  The Panel as- sessed the available data for each treatment to  determine whether a specific intervention dem- onstrated sufficient efficacy to be included as a  treatment alternative. The types of studies  available (randomized trials, observational  studies), quality of individual studies, consis- tency of outcome across studies, and gener- alizability of samples, settings, and interven- tions were examined and overall evidence  strength determined. The quality of individual  studies is conceptually distinct from the cate- gorization of overall evidence strength. For ex- ample, individual studies may be of high qual- ity but if findings are contradictory or samples  do not generalize well to the patient population  addressed by the guideline, then evidence  strength may be downgraded.      The balance between benefits and risks/ burdens (i.e., adverse events) was considered.  The Panel conceptualized risks/burdens in  terms of the invasiveness of the treatment, the  duration and severity of potential adverse  events, and the reversibility of potential ad- verse events. With regard to treatment inva- siveness, oral treatments were judged to be  less invasive than intravesical treatments and  intravesical treatments were judged to be less  invasive than surgical treatments. With regard  to duration of adverse events, some adverse  events either diminish over time and/or readily  cease upon cessation of the treatment (e.g.,  medication side effects). Some adverse events,  however, can persist for long periods after the  treatment has been discontinued (e.g., the  need for intermittent self - catheterization in  some patients several months after intradetru- sor BTX - A treatment). With regard to the se- verity of adverse events, potential adverse  events vary in the extent to which they can  compromise QoL. For example, medication side  effects can be mild (e.g., pentosan polysulfate)  or severe enough to constitute the major rea- son for study withdrawal (e.g., amitriptyline).  Further, some procedures and substances have  the potential for rare but life - threatening ad- verse events (e.g., sepsis with intravesical BCG  administration). Adverse events also vary in  their reversibility. Most medication side effects  cease upon discontinuation of the substance  and are completely reversible. Surgical treat- ments, however, are irreversible.         Treatment alternatives were then cate- gorized as clinical principles, expert opinion or    Guideline Statement 9    </p>

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     45   Disclaimer     This   document was written by the Interstitial  Cystitis Guidelines Panel of the American  Urological Association Education and Research,  Inc., which was created in 2008. The Practice  Guidelines Committee (PGC) of the AUA se- lected the committee chair. Panel members  were selected by the chair. Membership of the  committee included urologists, nurses, and  other clinicians with specific expertise on this  disorder. The mission of the committee was to  develop recommendations that are analysis - based or consensus - based, depending on Panel  processes and available data, for optimal clini- cal practices in the diagnosis and treatment of  interstitial cystitis.      Funding of the committee was provided  by the AUA. Committee members received no  remuneration for their work. Each member of  the committee provided a conflict of interest  disclosure to the AUA.     AUA guidelines   provide guidance only,  and do not establish a fixed set of rules or de- fine the legal standard of care.  As medical  knowledge expands and technology advances,  the guidelines will change. Today these  evi- dence - based  guidelines statements represent  not absolute mandates but provisional propos- als for treatment under the specific conditions  described in each document. For all these rea- sons, the guidelines do not pre - empt physician  judgment in individual cases. Also, treating  physicians must take into account variations in  resources, and in patient tolerances, needs,  and preferences.

American Urological Association    Interstitial Cystitis    4           INTRODUCTION      Purpose   Purpose       This guideline‘s purpose is to provide direction  to clinicians and patients regarding how to:  recognize interstitial cystitis (IC)/bladder pain  syndrome (BPS); conduct a valid diagnostic  process; and, approach treatment with the  goals of maximizing symptom control and pa- tient quality of life (QoL) while minimizing ad- verse events and patient burden. The strate- gies and approaches recommended in this  document were derived from evidence - based  and consensus - based processes. IC/BPS no- menclature is a controversial issue; for the  purpose of clarity, the Panel decided to refer to  the syndrome as IC/BPS and to consider these  terms synonymous. There is a continually ex- panding literature on IC/BPS; the Panel notes  that this document constitutes a clinical strat- egy and is not intended to be interpreted rig- idly. The most effective approach for a particu- lar patient is best determined by the individual  clinician and patient. As the science relevant to  IC/BPS evolves and improves, the strategies  presented here will require amendment to re- main consistent with the highest standards of  clinical care.                                                Methodology       A systematic review was conducted to iden- tify published articles relevant to the diagno- sis and treatment of IC/BPS. Literature  searches were performed on English - language publications using the MEDLINE da- tabase from January 1, 1983 to July 22, 2009  using the terms ―interstitial cystitis,‖ ―painful  bladder syndrome,‖ ―bladder pain syndrome,‖  and ―pelvic pain‖ as well as key words cap- turing the various diagnostic procedures and  treatments known to be used for these syn- dromes. Studies published after July 22,  2009 were not included as part of the evi- dence base considered by the Panel from  which evidence - based guideline statements  (Standards, Recommendations, Options)  were derived. A few studies published after  this cut - off date provided relevant informa- tion and are cited in the text as background  material. Data from studies published after  the literature search cut - off will be incorpo- rated into the next version of this guideline.  Preclinical studies (e.g., animal models), pe- diatric studies, commentary and editorials  were eliminated. Review article references  were checked to ensure inclusion of all possi- bly relevant studies. Studies using treat- ments not available in the United States,  herbal or supplement treatments, or studies  that reported outcomes information collapsed  across multiple interventions also were ex- cluded. Studies on mixed patient groups (i.e.,  some patients did not have IC/BPS) were re- tained as long as more than 50% of patients  were IC/BPS patients. Multiple reports on the  same patient group were carefully examined  </p>

As with  other sections of the guideline, this information  is presented as a suggested framework for the  clinical approach; it is not intended to replace  the judgments of individual clinicians and pa- tients regarding the optimal components of  treatment.     Guideline Statement 10.       Patients should be educated about normal  bladder function, what is known and not  known about IC/BPS, the benefits vs.  risks/burdens of the available treatment  alternatives, the fact that no single treat- ment has been found effective for the ma- jority of patients, and the fact that accept- able symptom control may require trials  of multiple therapeutic options (including  combination therapy) before it is  achieved.  Clinical Principle       Discussion.   The first - line treatment approach  should include patient education regarding nor- mal bladder function and what is known and  not known about IC/BPS and the fact that it is  typically a chronic disorder requiring continual  and dynamic management. Patients also  should be educated regarding the available  treatment alternatives, the fact that no single  treatment has been found to be effective for a  majority of patients, and that adequate symp- tom control is achievable but may require trials  of multiple therapeutic options to identify the  regimen that is effective for that patient. Pa- tients should be counseled that identifying an  effective pain relief regimen may require multi- ple trials of different medications in order to  identify the medication(s) that produce opti- mal effects for that particular patient. Fur- ther, patients should be informed that, given  the chronic nature of IC/BPS, the typical  course involves symptom exacerbations and  remissions.       Guideline Statement 11.       Self - care practices and behavioral modi- fications that can improve symptoms  should be discussed and implemented as  feasible.  Clinical Principle       Discussion.  Clinical experience and a limited  literature suggest that modifying certain be- haviors can improve symptoms in some IC/ BPS patients. 90   Suggesting that patients be- come aware of and avoid specific behaviors  which, reproducibly for a particular patient,  worsen symptoms, is appropriate and can  provide some sense of control in a disease  process which can be a devastating ordeal.  Behavioral modification strategies may in- clude: altering the concentration and/or vol- ume of urine, either by fluid restriction or ad- ditional hydration; application of local heat or  cold over the bladder or perineum; avoidance  of certain foods known to be common bladder  irritants for IC/BPS patients such as coffee or  citrus products; use of an elimination diet to  determine which foods or fluids may contrib- ute to symptoms; over - the - counter products  (e.g., neutraceuticals, calcium glycerophos- phates, pyridium); techniques applied to trig- ger points and areas of hypersensitivity (e.g.,  application of heat or cold); strategies to  manage IC/BPS flare - ups (e.g. meditation,  Guideline Statement 10 — 11   </p>

Systemic long - term glucocorticoid  administration should not be offered as the pri- mary treatment for IC/BPS symptoms. This  Recommendation is based on the findings from  two observational studies. 179, 180   Although high  rates of efficacy were reported (47 to 64%),  given the extremely small combined sample  size of fewer than 30 patients, the relatively  serious adverse events (e.g., new diabetes on- set, exacerbation of existing diabetes, pneu- monia with septic shock, increased blood pres- sure), and the known risks of systemic long - term glucorticoid use, risks/burdens clearly  outweigh benefits and the Panel recommends  that this therapy not be used long - term. This  Recommendation does not preclude the use of  short - term glucocorticoid therapy to manage  symptom flares.                                       Future Research       Patients with IC/BPS constitute a previously  under - recognized and underserved popula- tion in need of adequate medical manage- ment. Over the past 20 years, there have  been significant efforts directed at under- standing the etiology and the therapeutic  challenges of this disease. These efforts were  spearheaded by U.S. patient support groups  that have urged the National Institutes of  Health to fund research studies to better un- derstand IC/BPS pathophysiology and to fund  clinical studies to identify valid treatment ap- proaches.       Treating IC/BPS patients presents a  significant challenge in clinical practice.  Treatment approaches may be local (directed  to the bladder) or systemic, range from be- havioral to pharmacological, and may include  many types of adjunctive therapy approaches  intended to optimize quality of life. Although  there are evidenced - based data supporting  certain treatment approaches for patients in  clinical studies, the unsolved question in clini- cal practice remains: ―Who is the ideal pa- tient for a given treatment approach?‖ Thus,  treatment of IC/BPS often requires a trial and  error approach.       IC/BPS, which was originally consid- ered to be a bladder disease, has now been  recognized as a chronic pain syndrome. 26, 179 - 181   There is a growing body of literature dem- onstrating that different visceral pain syn- dromes, as well as pain syndromes in other  body regions, and other systemic diseases  often occur together in the same patient.  Thus, efforts to understand the pathophysiol-   Future Research   </p>

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     41   it is not clear, if studies evaluating the re- sponse to an evoked visceral stimulus can be  used to predict the response to spontaneous  visceral pain, since the neurophysiological  mechanisms are likely to be different. In the  past questionnaires have been used to assess  a global response or individual symptoms re- lated to IC/BPS. However, as the definition of  IC/BPS appears to be expanding from a blad- der disease to a chronic pain syndrome, reli- able new outcome measures will have to be  developed. Again, a biomarker would be an  ideal outcome measure, if it would measure  the presence of IC/BPS and changes in the bio- marker would reflect a response to treatment.  Many IC/BPS patients suffer from other chronic  pain conditions as well. Outcome measures in  clinical trials will have to track these comorbid- ities, so that different subgroups of IC/BPS pa- tients can be identified and responders versus  non - responders categorized appropriately.     IC has only been recognized as a highly  prevalent health problem in the past 20 years.  Data regarding disease progression, remission,  and prevention are very limited and we know  very little about risk factors for development of  associated symptoms over time. Patients are  currently treated with a variety of different  medications and other treatment interventions  on an empirical basis by different clinicians.  There is an urgent need for a long - term regis- try for these patients following them over sev- eral decades prospectively. Such a registry will  provide information about the natural course of  the disease and information about treatment  interventions found to be effective could pro- vide a basis for future clinical trials. 186     Although progress in developing specific  IC/BPS treatments has been slow, these are  exciting times for the development of new  treatment targets. 187   Modulation of visceral  nociceptive pathways can occur at peripheral,  spinal and supra - spinal sites and a wide vari- ety of potential drug targets exists. Com- pounds that hit several targets might be the  best option for a successful approach in the  short term, carefully evaluating the benefits  of each sequentially. However, there is  emerging evidence that a more refined ap- proach may be achievable. 188   In addition, re- search is needed on antiproliferative factors  (APF) as a possible therapeutic pathway for  treatment of IC/BPS. APF is a frizzled 8 pro- tein secreted by the bladder epithelial cells of  patients with IC/BPS. It inhibits uroepithelial  cell proliferation by decreasing heparin bind- ing epidermal growth factor - like growth fac- tor (HB - EGF). 189   APF has been shown to be a  sensitive and specific biomarker for IC/BPS  vs. controls. 189   It has been speculated that  APF suppression of uroepithelial cell prolifera- tion after bladder injury may result in clinical  IC/BPS, and inhibition of APF may be an ef- fective treatment or prevention 190 , but fur- ther research is needed.

                                            <p>22. American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis   22    evidence - based statements and divided into  first - , second - , third - , fourth - , fifth - , and sixth - line groups. This hierarchy was derived by bal- ancing the potential benefits to the patient with  the invasiveness of the treatment, the duration  and severity of potential adverse events, and  the reversibility of potential adverse events.  Note that the hierarchy was not established  based on evidence strength. For example, first - line treatments (composed of Clinical Princi- ples) in the Panel‘s judgment present essen- tially no risks to patients and should be offered  to all patients. Second - line treatments vary in  evidence strength but have in common that  they appear to benefit at least a subset of pa- tients, pose the least risk to patients in terms  of invasiveness and adverse event duration/ severity, and are readily reversible. For treat- ments with a sufficient evidence base, judg- ments regarding evidence strength and the  balance between benefits and risks/burdens  then were used to determine statement type  (Standard, Recommendation or Option).     Each set of treatments is presented be- low. Most treatments are designated as Op- tions with the exception of fulguration of Hun- ner‘s lesions (this treatment is designated as a  Recommendation). In most cases, the designa- tion of Option reflects the Panel‘s judgment  that uncertainty existed for the balance be- tween benefits and risks/burdens for a particu- lar treatment. One source of uncertainty was  the Panel‘s observation that most treatments  may benefit a subset of patients that is not  readily identifiable pre - treatment and but that  no treatment reliably benefits most or all pa- tients. Therefore, on average and for a particu- lar patient, uncertainty exists for most treat- ments regarding the balance between bene- fits and risks/burdens. Uncertainty also is  present when the available studies appear to  demonstrate efficacy but the total number of  patients exposed to a particular treatment is  small (e.g., cimetidine studies). In this cir- cumstance the Panel judged that the small  sample size constituted an additional source  of uncertainty. For one treatment designated  an Option (oral pentosan polysulfate), several  randomized trials were available. In this case,  the available evidence resulted in the judg- ment of relative certainty that the balance  between benefits and risks/burdens was ap- proximately equal because the trials were  contradictory and that treatment is most ap- propriately designated as an Option.     Given the lack of understanding re- garding pathophysiological causal factors in  IC/BPS and the consequence that treatment  goals are to control symptoms to optimize  quality of life, the Panel judged that the most  appropriate course was to preserve treat- ments as clinical choices as long as some effi- cacy for some patients was demonstrated  and the risk of serious harms was low. In  contrast, fulguration of Hunner‘s lesions was  designated a Recommendation (based Grade  C evidence) because little to no uncertainty  existed regarding the fact that benefits (large  and sustained treatment effects) clearly out- weighed risks/burdens.

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     26   chronic pain syndrome, little is known about  effective pharmacological treatment for chronic  pain in these patients. 21, 104, 105   The Panel‘s  clinical experience reflected diverse approaches  to effective pain management, ranging from  primary management by the practicing urolo- gist to use of a multidisciplinary team incorpo- rating an anesthesia/pain specialist. The deci- sion regarding how to approach this issue de- pends on the judgment and experience of the  involved clinician(s), the severity of the pa- tient‘s symptoms, and the availability of exper- tise and resources.     Given the current state of knowledge,  pharmacological pain management principles  for IC/BPS should be similar to those for man- agement of other chronic pain states. Cur- rently, there is no method to predict which  drug is most likely to alleviate pain in a given  IC/BPS patient. Clinicians and patients should  be aware that a multimodal approach in which  pharmacologic agents are combined with other  therapies is likely to be the most effective. In  addition, effective treatment of symptom flares  may require a pain treatment protocol with  some flexibility to manage flare - related break- through pain.     The goal of pharmacotherapy is to find  medication/medications that provide significant  pain relief with minimal side effects. Pain man- agement tools include urinary analgesics,  NSAIDs, narcotics and a wide variety of non- narcotic medications used for chronic pain  which have been ―borrowed‖ from the treat- ment of depression, epilepsy, arrhythmias, etc.  The use of narcotics presents the risks of toler- ance and dependence (although very rarely ad- diction) but it is clear that many patients bene- fit from narcotic analgesia as part of a com- prehensive program to manage pain. Some  of the essential principles of pain manage- ment include:   1.   The rights and responsibilities of the  patient and clinician should be clearly  stated at the outset; this may take the  form of a pain management ―contract‖.   2.   All narcotic prescriptions must come  from a single source.   3.   Increasing doses of medication should  be tied to improving function in activi- ties of  daily living (e.g., work, parent- ing, sexual intimacy, ability to exer- cise) rather than to just relief of pain.  The patient and clinician should set  mutual goals in these areas.    4.   Patients who require continuous nar- cotic therapy should be primarily man- aged with long - acting narcotics. Small  doses of short acting narcotics can be  used for ―breakthrough‖ pain.   5.   Multimodality therapy may help to  minimize narcotic use and the risk of  tolerance. Narcotic medications should  be used in combination with one of the  non - narcotic drugs.   6.   Complementary therapy (e.g., physical  therapy, counseling/pain psychology,  stress management), should be con- sidered as they may minimize the de- pendence on pain medications.       It is important that the patient under- stand that finding the medication or combina- tion of medications that provide effective pain  control requires a  ̳trial and error‘ method of  prescribing.

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     27   administered should be determined and only  one drug should be titrated at a time; other- wise it is not possible to assess the effects of a  certain drug on pain scores. The starting dose  should always be the smallest available and  titration should occur at frequent intervals,  guided by pain scores and side effects. This re- quires frequent contact between the patient  and the clinician. It is important for the patient  and the prescribing clinician to understand that  some side effects actually improve as the pa- tient continues to take the drug for several  weeks.    If these side effects are not intolerable, then  the patient should be guided through this pe- riod. Using these general guidelines of pain  management, a pain medication or combina- tion of pain medications can often be identified  that significantly relieve pain in IC/BPS pa- tients. Patients and clinicians should be aware  that 100% pain relief is often not achievable;  the focus of pain management is to minimize  discomfort and maximize the patient‘s ability  to function in daily life.     Whether pain management is best ac- complished by the primary treating clinician  and/or by a multidisciplinary team or other  pain specialists should be determined by the  individual clinician in consultation with the pa- tient. Patients with intractable pain and/or  complex presentations may require referral to  other specialists to achieve satisfactory pain  control. It is important to note that pain man- agement alone does not constitute sufficient  treatment for IC/BPS; pain management is one  component of treatment. To the extent possi- ble, it is essential that patients also are treated  for the underlying bladder - related symptoms.   Guideline Statement 15.     Amitriptyline, cimetidine, hydroxyzine,  or pentosan polysulfate may be adminis- tered as second - line oral medications  (listed in alphabetical order; no hierar- chy is implied).  Options       Discussion.  Amitriptyline   (Evidence  Strength  –   Grade B; Balance between  benefits &amp; risks/burdens uncertain).  One  randomized controlled trial reported efficacy  of oral amitriptyline (25 mg daily titrated  over several weeks to 100 mg daily if toler- ated) to be superior to placebo (63% of  treatment group clinically significantly im- proved compared to 4% of placebo group) at  four months. 106   Two observational studies re- ported similar findings of 50% to 64% of pa- tients experiencing clinically significant im- provement using a similar dosing regimen at  up to 19 months of follow - up. 107, 108   Adverse  events were extremely common (up to 79%  of patients) and, although not life - threatening, had substantial potential to com- promise quality of life (e.g., sedation, drowsi- ness, nausea). Medication side effects were  the major reason for withdrawal from the  studies. The available data suggest that be- ginning at low doses (e.g., 25 mg) and titrat- ing gradually to 75 - 100 mg if tolerated is an  acceptable dosing regimen. Given that  amitriptyline appears to benefit a subset of  patients in the setting of a high likelihood for  adverse events that compromise quality of  life, it was designated as an Option.

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     17     When cystoscopy is performed with hy- drodistension under anesthesia, interpreting  findings relevant to an IC/BPS diagnosis be- comes even more complicated. Hydrodisten- sion methods vary widely. Duration, pressure,  and number of hydrodistension episodes per  session vary greatly in clinical practice on sur- vey analysis. 80   Given the differing approaches,  the finding of glomerulations on hydrodisten- tion is variable and not consistent with clinical  presentation. 81, 82   For the same reasons, the  absence of glomerulations can lead to false  negative assessment of patients who present  with clinical findings consistent with IC/BPS. 83   In addition, glomerulations may be seen in pa- tients who have undergone radiation therapy,  in the presence of active bladder carcinoma,  associated with chemotherapeutic or toxic drug  exposure, and in patients with defunctionalized  bladders. Therefore, hydrodistension is not  necessary for routine clinical use to establish a  diagnosis of  IC/BPS diagnosis. If hydrodisten- sion is performed to determine whether Hun- ner‘s lesions are present or as a treatment,  then the technique should be specified and the  bladder capacity determined. It is useful for  the clinician and patient to understand when  bladder capacity is severely reduced (a low ca- pacity due to fibrosis). 84     Similar to cystoscopy, there are no  agreed - upon urodynamic criteria diagnostic for  IC/BPS. There can be significant discomfort as- sociated with the testing methodology and  findings in IC/BPS patients are inconsistent.  Bladder sensations reported during cystometric  bladder filling may be normal or markedly ab- normal, possibly due to the subjective nature  of bladder sensory function. 85   Pain with filling  (hypersensitivity) is consistent with IC/BPS.  Most patients will have normal filling pressure  and compliance. Detrusor overactivity (DO) is  seen in approximately 12 - 20% of IC/BPS pa- tients. 85   In these cases, it can be difficult to  determine whether the diagnosis is DO alone  or IC/BPS in combination with DO. Patients  with DO alone may report discomfort during  cystometric bladder filling and may be non - responsive to antimuscarinic drugs. However, if  the patient also meets the clinical definition  criteria for IC/BPS, then it is reasonable to di- agnose both conditions. Pelvic floor muscle  dysfunction may manifest as high resting ure- thral pressure, functional bladder outlet ob- struction due to poor relaxation of the sphinc- ter associated with pain - induced pelvic floor  muscle dysfunction, and poor contractility due  to bladder inhibition from non - relaxing pelvic  floor muscles. 86   Therefore, urodynamic evalua- tion may provide information regarding con- comitant voiding dysfunction. Specific indica- tions that urodynamic evaluation may be use- ful include suspicion of outlet obstruction in ei- ther sex, possibility of poor detrusor contractil- ity, and other conditions that could explain  why patients are initially refractory to first - line  therapy. In general, however, urodynamics are  not recommended for routine clinical use to es- tablish an IC/BPS diagnosis.

Initial treatment type and level should de- pend on symptom severity, clinician judg- ment, and patient preferences; appropri- ate entry points into the treatment por- tion of the algorithm depend on these fac- tors. Counseling patients with regard to  reasonable expectations for treatment  outcomes is important.  Clinical Principle       Discussion.  Effective management of IC/BPS  patients requires tailoring of treatments to  symptom type and severity as well as ensuring  that patients have reasonable expectations for  treatment benefits. Please see the Treatment  section and patient education section  (Statement 10) for more discussion of these  issues.       Guideline Statement 6.         Multiple, concurrent treatments may be  considered if it is in the best interests of  the patient; baseline symptom assess- ment and regular symptom level re - assessment are essential to document ef- ficacy of single and combined treatments.  Clinical Principle       Discussion.  Some patients may benefit from  the use of concurrent treatments or may re- quire the use of concurrent treatments to opti- mize quality of life. Documenting treatment  progress achieved with single and multiple  treatment approaches is critical to ensure that  ineffective treatments are ceased (see discus- sion under Statement 7) and that only effec- tive treatments (alone and/or in combination)  are continued. Please see the Treatment sec- tion for details on available treatments.      Guideline Statement 7.        Ineffective treatments should be stopped  once a clinically - meaningful interval has  elapsed.   Clinical Principle       Discussion.  IC/BPS treatment alternatives are  characterized by the fact that most treatments  may benefit a subset of patients that is not  identifiable pre - treatment but that no treat- ment reliably benefits most or all patients. It is  not uncommon, therefore, for a particular pa- tient to experience lack of benefit from a par- ticular treatment. For this reason, if a clinically - meaningful trial of a therapy has been con- ducted without efficacy, then the therapy  should be discontinued and other therapeutic  alternatives considered. See Treatment section  for details.       Guideline Statement 8.       Pain management should be continually  assessed for effectiveness because of its  importance to quality of life.  If pain man- agement is inadequate, then considera- tion should be given to a multidisciplinary  approach and the patient referred appro- priately.  Clinical Principle       Discussion.

In a few cases, individual studies con- stituted the only report on a particular treat- ment. Because sample sizes in individual stud- ies were small, single studies were not consid- ered a sufficient and reliable evidence base  from which to construct an evidence - based  statement (i.e., a Standard, Recommendation,  or Option). These studies were used to support  Clinical Principles as appropriate.     IC/BPS Diagnosis and Overall Manage- ment.   The review revealed insufficient publi- cations to address IC/BPS diagnosis and overall  management from an evidence basis; the diag- nosis and management portions of the algo- rithm (see Figure 1), therefore, are provided as  Clinical Principles   or as  Expert Opinion   with  consensus achieved using a modified Delphi  technique if differences of opinion emerged. 1   A  Clinical Principle   is a statement about a compo- nent of clinical care that is widely agreed upon  by urologists or other clinicians for which there  may or may not be evidence in the medical lit- erature.  Expert Opinion   refers to a statement,  achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is  based on members' clinical training, experi- ence, knowledge, and judgment for which  there is no evidence.       IC/BPS Treatment.   With regard to treat- ment, a total of 86 articles met the inclusion  criteria; the Panel judged that these were a  sufficient evidence base from which to con- struct the majority of the treatment portion of  the algorithm. Data on study type (e.g., ran- domized controlled trial, randomized crossover  trial, observational study), treatment parame- ters (e.g., dose, administration protocols, fol- low - up durations), patient characteristics  (i.e., age, gender, symptom duration), ad- verse events, and primary outcomes (as de- fined by study authors) were extracted. The  primary outcome measure for most studies  was some form of patient - rated improvement  scale. For studies that did not use this type of  measure, other outcomes were extracted  [e.g., interstitial cystitis Symptom Index  (ICSI), interstitial cystitis problem index  (ICPI), visual analog scales (VAS)].       Quality of Individual Studies and Deter- mination of Evidence Strength . Quality of  individual studies that were randomized con- trolled trials (RCTs) or crossover trials was  assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias  tool. 2   Because placebo effects are common in  controlled trials conducted with IC/BPS pa- tients, any apparent procedural deviations  that could compromise the integrity of ran- domization or blinding resulted in a rating of  increased risk of bias for that particular trial.  Because there is no widely agreed upon qual- ity assessment tool for observational studies,  the quality of individual observational studies  was not assessed.     The categorization of evidence  strength is conceptually distinct from the  quality of individual studies. Evidence  strength refers to the body of evidence avail- able for a particular question and includes  consideration of study design, individual  study quality, the consistency of findings  across studies, the adequacy of sample sizes,  and the generalizability of samples, settings,  and treatments for the purposes of the guide- </p>

The basic assessment should include a  careful history, physical examination and  laboratory examination to document  symptoms and signs that characterize IC/ BPS and exclude other disorders that  could be the cause of the patient’s symp- toms.  Clinical Principle         Discussion.  The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS  requires a careful history, physical examination  and laboratory examination to document basic  symptoms that characterize the disorder and  exclude infections and other disorders (see Fig- ure 1: Diagnostic and Treatment Algorithm). 62 - 65   The clinical history should include questions  about symptom duration. IC is a chronic disor- der and symptoms should be present for at  least six weeks with documented negative  urine cultures for infection. The number of  voids per day, sensation of constant urge to  void, and the location, character and severity  of pain, pressure or discomfort should be docu- mented. Dyspareunia, dysuria, ejaculatory pain  in men and the relationship of pain to men- struation in women should also be noted.      The physical examination should include  an abdominal and pelvic examination noting  masses, tenderness, and presence of hernias.  The pelvic examination should include palpa- tion of the external genitalia, bladder base in  females and urethra in both sexes focusing on  areas of tenderness. The pelvic floor muscles  in both sexes should be palpated for locations  of tenderness and trigger points. The pelvic  support for the bladder, urethra, vagina, and  rectum should be documented. A focused  evaluation to rule out vaginitis, urethritis, ten- der prostate, urethral diverticulum or other po- tential source of pain or infection is important.  For a more detailed discussion, please see  Weiss 2001. 66   A trial of antibiotic therapy is  appropriate when infection is suspected; if  symptoms resolve one might consider a course  of antibiotic suppression to allow for full recov- ery. A brief neurological exam to rule out an  occult neurologic problem and an evaluation  for incomplete bladder emptying to rule out  occult retention should be done on all patients.     The basic laboratory examination in- cludes a urinalysis and urine culture. If the pa- tient reports a history of smoking and/or pre- sents with unevaluated microhematuria, then  cytology may be considered given the high risk  of bladder cancer in smokers. Urine culture  may be indicated even in patients with a nega- tive urinalysis in order to detect lower levels of  bacteria that are clinically significant but not  readily identifiable with a dipstick or on micro- scopic exam.       Guideline Statement 2.     Baseline voiding symptoms and pain lev- els should be obtained in order to meas- ure subsequent treatment effects.  Clinical  Principle            Discussion.   It is important to establish base- line values in order to evaluate later treatment  responses. Very low voiding frequencies or  high voided volumes should prompt a diligent  search for an alternate diagnosis. At least a  one - day voiding log should be used to estab- lish the presence of a low volume frequency  voiding pattern that is characteristic of IC/ American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     14     Guideline Statement 1 — 2    GUIDELINE STATEMENTS   </p>

The published literature  regarding the typical course of IC/BPS is con- flicting. Some studies suggest that IC/BPS is a  chronic condition with a waxing and waning  course with, on average, little improvement  over time while other studies suggest that  most patients seem to improve over time. 87 - 89   Conflicting information is not surprising given  that studies have been conducted on different  patient populations and have had different pur- poses (e.g., documenting disease course vs.  treating the disease in the context of a con- trolled trial). It is clear, however, that there is  a limited understanding of IC/BPS pathophysi- ology and that most treatments are targeted at  symptom control. In addition, treatment stud- ies suggest that no single treatment works well  over time for a majority of patients. Until more  definitively effective therapies are identified,  the treatment approach should be tailored to  the specific symptoms of each patient in order  to optimize quality of life. To optimally treat  patients with a more complex presentation  and/or when standard treatment approaches  are ineffective, urologists may need to partner  with other clinicians such as primary care pro- viders, nurse practitioners, registered dieti- tians, physical therapists, pain specialists, gas- troenterologists, and/or gynecologists.       Overall Management .   The information pre- sented on   Overall Management   of IC/BPS in  this section is based on Clinical Principles or  Expert Opinion with consensus achieved using  a modified Delphi technique. This section is of- fered to provide clinicians and patients with a  framework and strategy for determining opti- mal treatment approaches (see Figure 1); it  is not intended to replace the judgment and  experience of the individual clinician faced  with a particular patient. The framework for  overall management includes the following:       Guideline Statement 4.         Treatment strategies should proceed us- ing more conservative therapies first  with less conservative therapies em- ployed if symptom control is inadequate  for acceptable quality of life; because of  their irreversibility, surgical treatments  (other than fulguration of Hunner’s le- sions) are generally appropriate only af- ter other treatment alternatives have  been exhausted or at any time in the  rare instance when an end - stage small,  fibrotic bladder has been confirmed and  the patient’s quality of life suggests a  positive risk - benefit ratio for major sur- gery.  Clinical Principle       Discussion.   The available treatments for  IC/BPS vary considerably in: invasiveness;  the probability, duration, severity and re- versibility of adverse events; and reversibility  of the treatment itself. Treatment strategies  should proceed from conservative therapies  to less conservative therapies. Please see the  Treatment section for detailed discussion of  this principle.

The AUA categorizes body of evidence  strength as Grade A (well - conducted RCTs or  exceptionally strong observational studies),  Grade B (RCTs with some weaknesses of pro- cedure or generalizability or generally strong  observational studies), or Grade C  (observational studies that are inconsistent,  have small sample sizes, or have other prob- lems that potentially confound interpretation of  data). Because treatment data for this condi- tion are difficult to interpret in the absence of a  placebo control, bodies of evidence comprised  entirely of studies that lacked placebo control  groups (i.e., observational studies) were as- signed a strength rating of Grade C.       AUA Nomenclature: Linking Statement  Type to Evidence Strength.   The AUA no- menclature system explicitly links statement  type to body of evidence strength and the  Panel‘s judgment regarding the balance be- tween benefits and risks/burdens. 3   Standards   are directive statements that an action should  (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should  not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be un- dertaken based on Grade A or Grade B evi- dence.  Recommendations   are directive state- ments that an action should (benefits outweigh  risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens  outweigh benefits) be undertaken based on  Grade C evidence.  Options   are non - directive  statements that leave the decision to take an  action up to the individual clinician and patient  because the balance between benefits and  risks/burdens appears relatively equal or ap- pears unclear;  Options   may be supported by  Grade A, B, or C evidence. In the treatment  portion of this guideline, most statements are  Options because most treatments demon- strate limited efficacy in a subset of patients  that is not readily identifiable  a priori . The  Panel interpreted these data to indicate that,  for a particular patient, the balance between  benefits and risks/burdens is uncertain or  relatively equal and whether to use a particu- lar treatment is a decision best made by the  clinician who knows the patient with full con- sideration of the patient‘s prior treatment his- tory, current quality of life, preferences and  values.       Limitations of the Literature.  The Panel  proceeded with full awareness of the limita- tions of the IC/BPS literature. These limita- tions include: poorly - defined patient groups  or heterogeneous groups; small sample  sizes; lack of placebo controls for many stud- ies, resulting in a likely over - estimation of  efficacy; short follow - up durations; and, use  of a variety of outcome measures. With re- gard to measures, even though the most  consistently used measure was some form of  patient - rated improvement scale, the scales  differed across studies in anchor points, num- ber of gradations, and descriptors. Overall,  these difficulties resulted in limited utility for  meta - analytic procedures. The single meta - analysis reported here was used to calculate  an overall effect size for data from random- ized trials that evaluated pentosan polysul- fate (PPS). No comparative procedures were  undertaken.   </p>

Similarly, self - report in- struments such as the O‘Leary - Sant Symptom  and Problem questionnaire and the Pelvic Pain  and Urgency/Frequency (PUF) questionnaire  can be used to establish a standardized symp- tom profile baseline for later evaluation of  treatment response. 27   These self - report instru- ments, however, are only useful to establish  baseline symptom values  –   they are not valid  tools for establishing a diagnosis.     The isolated pain component also should  be evaluated in patients who report pain or  other descriptors of discomfort such as pres- sure. The goal of this evaluation is to gather  information regarding pain/discomfort location  (s), intensity, and characteristics, and to iden- tify factors that exacerbate or alleviate pain or  discomfort. There are several ways in which to  assess pain and discomfort. The O‘Leary - Sant  ICSI/ICPI is useful to gather comprehensive  symptom information, including symptoms in  addition to those of pain or discomfort. 68   A one  to 10 Likert - style visual analog scale (VAS) is a  simple, easily - administered instrument that  can capture pain intensity. Pain body maps can  be used with patients whose presentation sug- gests a more global pain syndrome. Patients  should be queried with regard to pain charac- teristics (e.g., burning, stabbing) or a pain ad- jective checklist can be offered (e.g, McGill  Pain Questionnaire  –   Short Form). 69   Patients  also should be queried regarding factors known  to worsen or improve pain or discomfort.     This information is an important compo- nent to establish a diagnosis of IC/BPS, pro- vides a baseline against which treatments can  be evaluated, and is used to determine the ap- propriate level of entry into the treatment al- gorithm. Many patients present with pain  symptoms suggesting involvement of multiple  organ systems. In such cases a multidiscipli- nary team of gastroenterology, neurology,  rheumatology, gynecology, pain clinic special- ists, and other disciplines should be consid- ered.     Disorders such as bacterial cystitis, uri- nary calculi, vaginitis, and less common prob- lems like carcinoma  in situ   of the bladder and  chronic bacterial prostatitis have significant  symptom overlap and must be systematically  excluded or identified and treated appropri- ately. The role of other tests can support the  diagnosis but have poor specificity for IC/ BPS. 70   Clinicians should carefully weigh the po- tential risks and burdens of particular tests  against the potential benefit to patients. For  example, urodynamic evaluation can identify  bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor overac- tivity. The finding of sensory urgency at low  bladder volumes with or without detrusor over- activity is not specific for IC/BPS.     In general, additional tests should be  undertaken only if findings will alter the treat- ment approach. As described in Statement 1, a  key goal of the evaluation is to identify and ex- clude other disorders that may be causing  symptoms. In contrast to cystoscopy, urody- namics, and radiologic imaging, the potassium  sensitivity test (PST) does not result in the    diagnosis of other disorders. In fact, it is con- sistently positive in some alternate disorders,  including bacterial cystitis and radiation cysti- tis. 71   If a patient has typical symptoms of IC/ BPS (e.g., frequent urination driven by pain    Guideline Statement 2   </p>

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     40   ogy and to design therapeutic modalities have  recently shifted from an organ - based approach  to a more global approach. 88   Reflecting this  new paradigm, the NIDDK has funded the Mul- tidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic  Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network  (www.mappnetwork.org). The MAPP network is  focused on a broader approach to the study of  IC/BPS and CP/CPPS than previously under- taken. A wide range of scientific discovery pro- jects, moving beyond the previous traditional  bladder -   and prostate - focused efforts, are be- ing conducted at six Discovery Sites. Investiga- tions include the relationship between IC/BPS,  CP/CPPS and other chronic pain conditions  (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and  irritable bowel syndrome), innovative epidemi- ological studies, search for clinically important  biomarkers, investigation of bacterial, viral and  other infectious causative/exacerbating agents,  novel brain imaging studies and animal studies  to better understand the pathophysiology of  these often disabling syndromes.       As the definition of IC/BPS has ex- panded, clinical trial design for this condition is  becoming more complex and challenging. Early  clinical trials have enrolled participants based  on NIDDK research criteria for IC. 182   However,  this approach resulted in two - thirds of poten- tial subjects being excluded at the outset. 5, 28   Further, IC/BPS patients with co - morbidities  have typically been excluded in clinical trials. 160   While there is a need in clinical research to en- roll a more homogeneous patient population,  this approach raises concerns about the clinical  relevance of such studies for the truly hetero- geneous IC/BPS population. Two strategies  may be useful to move the field forward. First,  entry criteria for these trials could be as  broad as possible to both improve the ability  to generalize the results and permit subgroup  analysis. 160   Second, clinically - important sub- groups could be identified  a priori   and evalu- ated for treatment responses. In future trials  it will be important to keep track of co - morbidities for clinical trial design, either for  the purpose of  post hoc   subgroup analysis or  a priori   subgroup recruitment, since the  neuro - pathophysiological mechanisms in IC/ BPS patients with different co - morbidities are  likely to be different. 24, 31, 33, 183, 184     A key issue for future clinical trial de- sign will be to identify clinically relevant ob- jective criteria for patient enrollment, and  this remains a challenge, which has delayed a  more aggressive approach of the pharmaceu- tical industry to identifying new treatment  avenues for this condition. A validated urine  marker for IC/BPS would be a major advan- tage in this disorder since it would provide an  objective criterion for participant enrollment  and allow sub - classification of various sub - groups of BPS.      The second major challenge in clinical  trial design remains the selection of outcome  measures. 160   Many patients have periods of  flares and remission. In other patients, symp- toms become more severe and frequent over  time. Thus it is difficult to establish a baseline  for the symptoms over a longer observation  period. It has been suggested by some inves- tigators to circumvent this problem by evalu- ating the response to an evoked painful vis- ceral stimulus, such as bladder distension,  either in normal volunteers, or in subjects  with visceral pain. 185   Conceptually, however,    Future Research   </p>

Given  the potential for placebo effects to persist for  long periods, only the data from the first  phases were examined if reported (i.e., before  the crossover). In the first study, blinded  evaluators used urodynamic and voiding pa- rameters to rate patient improvement  (―objective criteria‖) and patients rated global  improvement (―subjective criteria‖). 119   The  protocol was four treatments of 50 cc 50%  DMSO instilled at two - week intervals with 15  minute retention; patients were evaluated at  one month post - treatment. At the end of Phase  1, evaluators indicated that 93% of DMSO pa- tients and 35% of placebo patients were im- proved. Patient ratings of improvement were  similar to evaluator ratings in the DMSO group  (87%) and higher than evaluator ratings in the  placebo group (59%). The second trial used six  weekly instillations  and reported that 47% of  patients administered DMSO (retention interval  not specified) reported improvement compared  to 0% of a BCG (two hour retention) instillation  group at three months. 120   There was no pla- cebo group in this study and data were not  broken out between phases. Several observa- tional studies using similar formulations and  instillation protocols ranging from weekly to  monthly to PRN and follow - up intervals of a  few months to several years reported efficacy  rates of 25 to 90%. 121 - 123   Adverse event rates  varied widely across studies, likely reflecting  different author thresholds for what constituted  an adverse event, but did not appear serious.  Given the available data, particularly the wide  range of efficacy rates reported, intravesical  DMSO instillation was designated as an Option.  If DMSO is used, then the panel suggests limit- ing instillation dwell time to 15 - 20 minutes;  DMSO is rapidly absorbed into the bladder  wall and longer periods of holding are associ- ated with significant pain. DMSO is often ad- ministered as a part of a ―cocktail‖ that may  include heparin, sodium bicarbonate, a local  steroid, and/or a lidocaine preparation. If a  clinician chooses to administer a ―cocktail‖  preparation, then he or she should be aware  that DMSO potentially enhances absorption of  other substances, creating the possibility for  toxicity from drugs such as lidocaine. No  clinical studies have addressed the safety or  increased efficacy of these preparations over  DMSO alone.       Discussion. Heparin  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade C; Balance between benefits &amp;  risks/burdens uncertain).   Three observa- tional studies reported findings from the use  of intravesical heparin. Using 10,000 IU  heparin in 10cm 3   sterile water three times a  week for three months with retention of one  hour, at three months 56% of patients re- ported clinically significant improvement. 124   A  subset of responders continued the treat- ments for up to one year, resulting in 40% of  patients overall reporting continued relief at  the one year point. Using 25,000 IU in 5 ml  distilled water twice a week for three months,  at three months 72.5% of patients reported  significant relief. 125   Efficacy also was reported  when combining heparin with lidocaine  (40,000 IU heparin, 3 ml 8.4% sodium bicar- bonate with 8 ml 1% or 2% lidocaine; see  Parsons (2005), under intravesical lidocaine)  and when combined with lidocaine and triam- cinolone (20,000 units heparin, 20 ml 2% li-   Guideline Statement 16   </p>

In the absence of placebo controlled trials,  it is difficult know the balance between benefits  and risks/burdens. It does appear that intrave- sical heparin on its own and in combination  with other substances may benefit a subset of  patients. For these reasons, it is designated an  Option.     Discussion.  Lidocaine  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade B; Balance between benefits &amp;  risks/burdens uncertain) .   One randomized  multi - center trial reported that three and ten  days after treatment (10 ml PSD597; patented  combination of 200 mg lidocaine alkalinized  with sequential instillation of 8.4% sodium bi- carbonate instilled once daily for five consecu- tive days with one hour retention), more pa- tients in the treatment group (30% and 24%  respectively) experienced clinically significant  improvement compared to patients in the pla- cebo group (10% and 11.5% respectively);  these differences were statistically significant  at Day 3 but not at Day 10. 128   An open - label  phase followed the placebo control phase in  this trial; in the open - label phase after five  treatments 54% of patients at three days and  48% at ten days reported significant improve- ment. The available observational studies re- ported even higher short - term efficacy  rates. 126, 129, 130   Alkalinization increases urothe- lial penetration of lidocaine and therefore is ex- pected to improve efficacy but it also can in- crease systemic absorption and potential toxic- ity. No published studies have directly com- pared lidocaine with and without alkalinization.  In one series from a large gynecology prac- tice, a lidocaine cocktail without bicarbonate  (20,000 units heparin, 20 ml 2% lidocaine,  40 mg triamcinolone) improved symptoms for  73% of BPS/IC patients. 127   Heparin or PPS  may be added. In one study comparing lido- caine plus PPS vs. lidocaine alone, some out- come measures were better in the lidocaine  plus PPS group. 131   No studies have directly  compared different lidocaine concentrations.  In one open - label trial, patients originally re- ceived 40,000 units heparin, 8 ml 1% lido- caine and 3 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate,  with a success rate of 75%. The success rate  increased to 94% after increasing the lido- caine concentration to 2%. 126   Adverse events  are typically not serious but include dysuria,  urethral irritation, and bladder pain. Given  that intravesical lidocaine instillation appears  to offer relief to a subset of patients but that  the relief is short - term (i.e., less than two  weeks) and the procedure can be associated  with pain, this treatment alternative was des- ignated an Option.     Third - Line Treatments:       Guideline Statement 17.       Cystoscopy under anesthesia with short - duration, low - pressure hydrodistension  may be undertaken if first -   and second - line treatments have not provided ac- ceptable symptom control and quality of  life or if the patient’s presenting symp- toms suggest a more invasive approach  is appropriate.

In the experience of the  Panel, patients undergoing laser therapy for  Hunner‘s lesions also should be forewarned of  the possibility of forward scatter and delayed  bowel perforation. Lesions also may be treated  using submucosal injections of a corticosteroid  (10 ml of triamcinolone acetonide, 40 mg/ml,  injected in 0.5 ml aliquots into the submucosal  space of the center and periphery of ulcers us- ing an endoscopic needle); this procedure re- sulted in 70% of patients reporting improve- ment with an average improvement duration of  seven to 12 months. 138   Lesion treatment ap- pears to constitute one of the few IC/BPS  therapies that results in improvement meas- ured in months with only a single exposure to  the procedure. Adverse events for laser and  injection studies were minimal. For these rea- sons, the Panel judged that benefits of Hun- ner‘s lesion treatment outweigh risks/burdens  and recommend that it be offered.     Fourth - Line Treatments :        Guideline Statement 19.       A trial of neurostimulation may be per- formed and, if successful, implantation of  permanent neurostimulation devices may  be undertaken if other treatments have  not provided adequate symptom control  and quality of life or if the clinician and  patient agree that symptoms require this  approach.  Option       Discussion. Neuromodulation  (Evidence  Strength  –   Grade C; Balance between  benefits &amp; risks/burdens uncertain) .  Three studies reported findings from perma- nent implant of sacral or pudendal neu- rostimulation devices. It is important to note  that neuromodulation is not currently FDA - approved for IC/BPS treatment; however,  many patients meet the frequency/urgency  indication for which sacral neurostimulation is  approved. One study used a randomized  crossover design to test temporary sacral vs.  pudendal neurostimulation and allowed pa- tients to select the preferred lead for perma- nent implantation. 140   At six months post - implant, 66% of patients reported clinically  significant improvement with patients who  had selected pudendal implants reporting  greater symptom relief than those who se- lected sacral implants. Two additional obser- vational studies reported on post - implant  outcomes at 14 months. 141   In one study,  94% of patients reported improvements in  bladder capacity, frequency, voided volume,  nocturia, pain, and ICSI/ICPI scores; the re- maining 6% reported improvement in all pa- rameters except for ICSI/ICPI scores. 141   In  the other study (a chart review), patients re- ported sustained improvements in frequency,  nocturia, the UDI - 6, and fecal incontinence.  Adverse events appeared to be minor (i.e.,  need for reprogramming, sterile seroma  around the electrode). 142   Given the small  number of patients studied, the invasiveness  of the procedure, and the lack of multi - year  follow - up data, the Panel judged that sacral/ pudendal neurostimulation may be effective  in carefully selected patients (i.e., tested with  a temporary implant) and this decision should  be left to the individual clinician and patient.

American Urological Association    Interstitial Cystitis    9              Background   common for patients to report a single symp- tom such as dysuria, frequency, or pain, with  subsequent progression to multiple symp- toms. 17, 18   Symptom flares, during which symp- toms suddenly intensify for several hours,  days, or weeks, are not uncommon. There is a  high rate of prior pelvic surgery (especially  hysterectomy) and levator ani pain in women  with IC/BPS, suggesting that trauma or other  local factors may contribute to symptoms. 19   It  is important to note, however, that the high  incidence of other procedures such as hyster- ectomy or laparoscopy may be the result of a  missed diagnosis and does not necessarily indi- cate that the surgical procedure itself is a con- tributing factor to symptoms. It is also com- mon for IC/BPS to coexist with other unex- plained medical conditions such as fibromyal- gia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue  syndrome, Sjogren‘s syndrome, chronic head- aches, and vulvodynia. 20, 21   These associations  suggest that there may be a systemic dysregu- lation in some patients. Finally, patients with  IC/BPS frequently exhibit mental health disor- ders such as depression and anxiety. While  these symptoms may be reactive in some IC/ BPS patients, there is also some evidence that  there may be a common biologic mechanism  involved. For instance, a link between IC/BPS  and panic disorder has been suggested from  genetic linkage studies. 22, 23       Conceptualizing IC/BPS.  It is not known  whether IC/BPS is a primary bladder disorder  or whether the bladder symptoms of IC/BPS  are a secondary phenomena resulting from an- other cause. Converging data from several  sources suggest, however, that IC/BPS can be  conceptualized as a bladder pain disorder  that is often associated with voiding sympto- matology and other systemic chronic pain  disorders.  Specifically, IC/BPS may be a  bladder disorder that is part of a more gener- alized systemic disorder, at least in a subset  of patients.   Initial observations suggesting this  conceptualization were made by Clauw and  colleagues (1997). He noted among chronic  pelvic pain patients that other chronic pain  disorders such as interstitial cystitis, irritable  bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome,  and fibromyalgia tended to co - occur. 24   He  suggested that there might be a common  central pathogenesis and pathophysiology for  these disorders. Self - report data collected by  the Interstitial Cystitis Association corrobo- rated Clauw‘s findings and showed an asso- ciation between IC/BPS and other chronic  pain disorders. 25   Aaron and Buchwald (2001)  analyzed a co - twin control study and sup- ported the findings previously reported by  Clauw and colleagues (1997). 26   Additional  epidemiologic studies support these data and  suggest that if the IC patient is properly as- sessed during the diagnostic evaluation,  many of these somatic symptoms are also  present.     Considering these data, it has been  suggested that IC/BPS is a member of a fam- ily of hypersensitivity disorders which affects  the bladder and other somatic/visceral or- gans, and has many overlapping symptoms  and pathophysiology. 27, 28   An additional hy- pothesis is that IC/BPS might be just a part  of the continuum of painful vs. non - painful  overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). 29, 30   </p>

Cysto- scopy with hydraulic distention of the bladder  in men with IC/BPS commonly demonstrates  diffuse glomerulations. 53   Some data suggest  that Hunner‘s ulcers are more common in male  IC/BPS patients. 54       Male IC/BPS vs. Chronic Prostatitis .   Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syn- drome (CP/CPPS), or NIH Type III prostatitis 55   is characterized by pain in the perineum, su- prapubic region, testicles or tip of the penis. 56   The pain is often exacerbated by urination or  ejaculation. Voiding symptoms, such as sense  of incomplete bladder emptying and urinary  frequency are also commonly reported, but  pain is the primary defining characteristic of  CP/CPPS. It is clear that the clinical character- istics which define CP/CPPS are very similar to  those previously described for IC/BPS. In gen- eral, the Panel believes that the diagnosis of  IC/BPS should be strongly considered in men  whose pain is perceived to be related to the  bladder. However, it is also quite clear that  certain men have symptoms which meet crite- ria for both conditions (IC/BPS and CP/CPPS).  In such cases, the treatment approach can in- clude established IC/BPS therapies as well as  other therapies that are more specific to    CP/CPPS. It is interesting to note that some  studies of patients with CP/CPPS have high  rates of bladder glomerulation under anesthe- sia. 57   Additionally, empiric IC/BPS strategies in  those CP/CPPS patients have demonstrated  clinical symptomatic improvement. 54, 57, 58       Diagnosis     The Diagnostic Approach.   The diagnosis  of IC/BPS can be challenging. Patients pre- sent with a wide spectrum of symptoms,  physical exam findings, and clinical test re- sponses. This complexity causes significant  misdiagnosis, under - diagnosis and delayed  diagnosis. 59   Insufficient literature was identi- fied to constitute an evidence base for diag- nosis of IC/BPS in clinical practice. The lack  of evidence is not surprising given the many  definitions of the disorder employed and the  focus of most trials on NIDDK diagnostic cri- teria (note that the NIDDK diagnostic criteria  are not appropriate for use outside of clinical  trials). 60, 61   For this reason, the section below  titled  Diagnosis   is based on Clinical Principles  or Expert Opinion with consensus achieved  using a modified Delphi technique when dif- ferences of opinion emerged. This section is  intended to provide clinicians and patients  with a framework for determining whether a  diagnosis of IC/BPS is appropriate; it is not  intended to replace the judgment and experi- ence of the individual clinician faced with a  particular patient.   </p>

Other controllable behaviors or conditions that  in some patients may worsen symptoms in- clude certain types of exercise (e.g., pelvic  floor muscle exercises  –   see below under  Physical Therapy), sexual intercourse, wearing  of tight - fitting clothing and the presence of  constipation.      The recent NIDDK trial on the effect of  amitriptyline on symptoms in treatment naïve  patients with IC/BPS included an arm of pa- tients randomized to a standardized education  and behavioral modification program (EBMP)  without active drug therapy.   The EBMP was  aimed at increasing understanding of the blad- der and voiding, techniques to manage stress  and pain symptoms, management of fluid in- take, bladder training and urge suppression, as  well as avoidance of food and beverage  ―symptom triggers‖. Forty - five percent of pa- tients (n=136) assigned to the EBMP plus pla- cebo group were markedly or moderately im- proved on the Global Response Assessment,  suggesting the benefits of self - care practices  and behavioral modification. 92   The study by  Foster and colleagues (2010) was published  after the literature search cut - off date and,  therefore, was not considered for the purpose  of creating evidence - based statements  (Standards, Recommendations, Options).

Clinical Principle     Discussion.  Psychological stress is associ- ated with heightened pain sensitivity in gen- eral. 95, 96   In laboratory studies, stress in- creases IC/BPS symptoms. 97   Effective coping  with family, work, and/or past traumatic ex- periences is an important component of  symptom management. Recommendations  for specific coping strategies are beyond the  scope of this guideline. However, clinicians  and patients should be cognizant of stressors  as triggers for symptom exacerbation and pa- tients should be encouraged and assisted to  seek appropriate support for these issues  from stress management or psychological  counselors.     Clinicians also may want to include  multi - disciplinary assistance as appropriate,  to manage as many factors as possible that  appear to precipitate or exacerbate symp- toms for each individual patient. These fac- tors may include irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS), endometriosis, recurrent vaginitis/ vestibulitis, severe predictable flares occur- ring with phase of menstrual cycle, panic at- tacks, depression, etc.     Second - line Treatments:       Guideline Statement 13.

One  randomized controlled trial reported efficacy of  oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) to be sta- tistically significantly superior to placebo in  terms of total symptoms, pain, and nocturia  after three months of treatment. 109   Two obser- vational studies reported that oral cimetidine  (300 mg twice daily or 200 mg three times  daily) resulted in 44% to 57% of patients re- porting clinically significant improvement at  follow - up intervals of one and more than two  years. 110, 111   No adverse events were reported.  Given the possibility that cimetidine may bene- fit a subset of patients without significant ad- verse events in the context of a small total  sample exposed to the drug (40 patients, in- cluding the RCT), the lack of long - term follow - up data on sufficient numbers of patients, and  its potential to interact with other drugs, oral  cimetidine was designated as an Option.       Discussion.  Hydroxyzine    (Evidence  Strength  –   Grade C; Balance between  benefits &amp; risks/burdens uncertain).   One  randomized controlled trial reported that more  patients in the treatment group (23%) experi- enced clinically significant improvement com- pared to patients in the placebo group (13%)  in response to oral hydroxyzine for six months  (10 mg daily titrated to 50 mg daily over sev- eral weeks if tolerated); this difference was not  statistically significant in this pilot study (study  was a full factorial design that included a PPS  arm which is discussed below). 112   One obser- vational study reported that 92% of patients  experienced clinically significant improvement  (25 mg daily titrated up to 75 mg daily over  several weeks); the patients in this study all  had systemic allergies and may represent a  patient subset that is more likely to respond  to hydroxyzine. 113   Adverse events were com- mon (up to 82% of patients but with a similar  proportion of placebo and treatment group  patients reporting adverse events in the RCT)  and generally not serious (e.g., short - term  sedation, weakness). The Panel interpreted  the disparate findings between the RCT and  the observational study to indicate uncer- tainty regarding the balance between benefits  and risks/burdens. Given the lack of serious  adverse events and the possibility that the  medication may benefit a subset of patients,  the administration of oral hydroxyzine was  designated as an Option.       Discussion.  Pentosanpolysulfate (PPS;   Evidence Strength  –   Grade B; Benefits =  risks/burdens).   PPS is by far the most - studied oral medication in use for IC/BPS.  Because there were seven randomized trials  reporting on more than 500 patients from  which to draw evidence (including five trials  that compared PPS to placebo, one trial that  examined PPS dose - response effects, and  one that compared PPS to cyclosporine A),  the numerous observational studies on PPS  were not used. The body of evidence strength  was categorized as Grade B because although  the individual trials were of high quality, the  findings from the trials were contradictory.     Of the five trials that included PPS and  placebo arms, four were RCTs. One multicen- ter RCT reported no differences at four  months of follow - up in total symptom scores    Guideline Statement 15    </p>
                                        
                                            <p>7. American Urological Association    Interstitial Cystitis    7              Background   Background       Definition.   The bladder disease complex in- cludes a large group of patients with bladder  and/or urethral and/or pelvic pain, lower uri- nary tract symptoms and sterile urine cultures,  many with specific identifiable causes.  IC/BPS  comprises a part of this complex. The Panel  used the IC/BPS definition agreed upon by the  Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology  (SUFU): ―An unpleasant sensation (pain, pres- sure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the  urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary  tract symptoms of more than six weeks dura- tion, in the absence of infection or other identi- fiable causes‖. 4   This definition was selected be- cause it allows treatment to begin after a rela- tively short symptomatic period, preventing  treatment withholding that could occur with  definitions that require longer symptom dura- tions (i.e., six months). Definitions used in re- search or clinical trials should be avoided in  clinical practice; many patients may be misdi- agnosed or have delays in diagnosis and treat- ment if these criteria are employed. 5         Epidemiology.   Since there is no objective  marker to establish the presence of IC/BPS,  studies to define its prevalence are difficult to  conduct. Population - based prevalence studies  of IC/BPS have used three methods: surveys  that ask participants if they have ever been di- agnosed with the condition (self - report stud- ies); questionnaires administered to identify  the presence of symptoms that are suggestive  of IC/BPS (symptom assessments); and, ad- ministrative billing data used to identify the  number of individuals in a population who have  been diagnosed with IC/BPS (clinician diag- nosis). Not surprisingly, the use of different  methods yields widely disparate prevalence  estimates.       Self - Report Studies . Two large - scale stud- ies in the United States have utilized self - report to estimate the prevalence of IC/BPS.  The first was conducted as part of the 1989  National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and  the second was part of the third National  Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys  (NHANES III), which was conducted between  1988 and 1994. The same definition of IC/ BPS was used in both studies. Participants  were asked, ―Have you ever had symptoms  of a bladder infection (such as pain in your  bladder and frequent urination) that lasted  more than 3 months?‖ Those who gave a  positive response were then asked, ―When  you had this condition, were you told that  you had interstitial cystitis or painful bladder  syndrome?‖ An affirmative answer to both  questions was considered to define the pres- ence of IC/BPS. The prevalence estimates ob- tained from these two studies were virtually  identical. In the NHIS, the overall prevalence  was 500 per 100,000 population, and the  prevalence in women was 865 per 100,000. 6   In NHANES III, the prevalence was 470 per  100,000 population, including 60 per 100,000  men and 850 per 100,000 women. 6   This  equals approximately 83,000 men and 1.2  million women across the United States.

BTX - A  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade C; Balance between benefits &amp;  risks/burdens uncertain) .  Six observational  studies reported on the use of BTX - A to treat  IC/BPS symptoms. One study reported efficacy  of 69% but did not indicate whether this oc- curred at one, three, or six months of follow  up. 147   Two studies reported high initial efficacy  rates of 74% and 86% at three months. 148, 149   One study reported that BFLUTS and KHQ  scores and frequency improved significantly at  3.5 months. 150   Effectiveness diminished over  time, however, and at one year symptoms  were indistinguishable from baseline values. 151   One study reported a low efficacy rate at three  months with only 20% of patients exhibiting  improvement. 152       In the absence of placebo controlled  studies, the true effect of BTX - A is not possible  to determine. However, overall, the BTX - A  studies suggest that a subset of patients ex- periences symptom relief for several months  after treatment with a return to baseline symp- tom levels over time. BTX - A treatment was  considered a fifth - line treatment because of  the seriousness and particularly the duration of  adverse events. Common adverse events in- cluded dysuria, the need for abdominal strain- ing to void, large post - void residuals (greater  than 100 ml), and the need for intermittent  self - catheterization that persisted for one to  three months and in some cases longer. Pa- tients must be willing to accept the possibility  that intermittent self - catheterization may be  necessary post - treatment. This option is not  appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate  catheterization. Given the potential short - term  efficacy in the context of a serious adverse  event profile, the Panel judged that intrade- trusor BTX - A administration is an Option with  the decision best made by the individual clini- cian and patient.      Sixth - Line Treatments :       Guideline Statement 22.       Major surgery (substitution cystoplasty,  urinary diversion with or without cystec- tomy) may be undertaken in carefully  selected patients for whom all other  therapies have failed to provide ade- quate symptom control and quality of  life (see caveat above in Guideline State- ment 4).  Option       Discussion. Major Surgery  (Evidence  Strength  –   Grade C; Balance between  benefits &amp; risks/burdens uncertain) .   IC/ BPS can be a major source of morbidity and  compromised quality of life but it also is a  non - malignant disorder. Major surgery should  be reserved for the small proportion of pa- tients with severe, unresponsive disease, who  are motivated to undergo the risks and life- long changes associated with irreversible ma- jor surgery. It can be considered earlier in  the course of disease in patients with a se- verely limited bladder capacity under anes- thesia such that no conservative therapy is  likely to significantly improve QoL. Patients  must understand that pain relief is not guar- anteed, and pain can persist even if the blad- der is removed.

Analysis of data extracted from multiple  databases, including the Centers for Medicare  &amp; Medicaid Services, National Center for Health  Statistics, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey,  National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur- vey, Department of Veterans Affairs, National  Association of Children's Hospitals and Related  Institutions, and various private data sets be- tween 1994 and 2000 revealed an increase of  29% from $37 to $66 million among persons  with a formal diagnosis of IC/BPS. Similarly,  the direct annual costs associated with BPS  rose from $481 million to $750 million  (amounts standardized to 1996 - 1998 val- ues). 43   Between 1992 and 2001 the rate of vis- its to physician‘s offices increased three - fold  and the rate of visits to hospital outpatient vis- its increased two - fold. 43   Only the rate of ambu- latory surgery visits declined during this pe- riod, which may be attributed to a shift to di- agnosis based on a symptom - based approach  rather than the more traditional procedure - based diagnostic evaluation. 43   While these  findings are thought to reflect an increased  awareness and diagnosis of IC/BPS, existing  evidence reveals that more than 92% of office  visits among patients with a diagnosis of IC/ BPS were to urologists. 43   In contrast, visits at- tributed to IC/BPS are found under a variety of  less specific codes including urinary frequency,  other specified symptoms associated with fe- male genital organs, or other unspecified  symptoms associated with the female genital  organs. 43   These findings suggest that misdiag- nosis and under - diagnosis remain common,  especially in the primary care setting.      The economic burden of IC/BPS for the  individual patient is even greater than the  impact on the healthcare system at large.  The mean annual healthcare costs following a  diagnosis of IC/BPS are 2.0 to 2.4 times  higher than age matched controls. 42, 43   A  study of 239 women diagnosed with IC and  cared for in a managed care setting found a  mean cost of $6,614, including $1,572 for  prescription medications, and $3,463 for out- patient medical services. 42, 44   In addition, a  woman who is diagnosed with IC/BPS will in- cur a higher mean cost than a male patient  diagnosed with the same condition. 43   A cross - sectional study of 43 women cared for in an  outpatient urology center found that the an- nual direct cost associated with a diagnosis of  IC/BPS based on Medicare rates was $3,631  per person, while the estimated costs based  on non - Medicare rates was nearly twice that  amount. 44   Indirect individual costs were esti- mated by querying lost wages due to symp- toms within a three - month period. Nineteen  percent of patients with IC/BPS reported lost  wages, resulting in a mean annual cost of  $4,216. The magnitude of these indirect  costs was greatest among women with se- vere symptoms as compared to those with  mild symptoms. 44   Although clearly substan- tial, these additional costs fail to reflect the  economic burden associated with commonly  occurring coexisting conditions. 45                           </p>

PST results do not change this decision. A posi- tive test is consistent with the existing clinical  plan. A negative test will not change the clini- cal plan, because 26% of patients who met the  strict NIDDK criteria for IC/BPS had a negative  test. 71   Another proposed role for the PST is to  identify the subset of patients who have  urothelial dysfunction. 71   Thus, in theory, PST  might help to identify the patients who are  most likely to respond to urothelium - restoring  treatments. However, the evidence to date re- veals minimal predictive value. PST findings  did not predict at least 50% improvement with  pentosanpolysulfate 71   or with combined hepari- noid and tricyclic antidepressant treatment 72 .  PST findings also did not predict success in a  randomized trial of PPS vs. cyclosporine A. 73   Findings from a modified PST predicted re- sponse to intravesical hyaluronic acid in one  study 74   but this treatment is not used in the  U.S. and unpublished data from two large mul- ticenter randomized controlled trials failed to  demonstrate efficacy. In addition, the PST is  painful and risks triggering a severe symptom  flare.  In view of the paucity of benefits, the  panel agreed the risk/benefit ratio was too    high for routine clinical use.       Guideline Statement 3.         Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics should be  considered when the diagnosis is in  doubt; these tests are not necessary for  making the diagnosis in uncomplicated  presentations.  Expert Opinion     Discussion.  Cystoscopy and urodynamic test- ing are appropriate as part of the diagnostic  approach when the basic assessment results  are in doubt about the IC/BPS diagnosis, or  when information that would be gained is  needed to guide therapy. The value of cysto- scopy is in excluding conditions that may  mimic IC/BPS and in the identification of a  Hunner‘s lesion. Identification of entities such  as bladder cancer, vesical stones, urethral di- verticula, and intravesical foreign bodies is  most consistently accomplished with cysto- scopy. Therefore, suspicion of these entities is  an indication for the diagnostic use of cysto- scopy.     There are no agreed - upon cystoscopic  findings diagnostic for IC/BPS, however. The  only consistent cystoscopic finding that leads  to a diagnosis of IC/BPS is that of one or sev- eral inflammatory appearing lesions or ulcera- tions as initially described by Hunner (1918). 75   These lesions may be identified in an acute  phase (as an inflamed, friable, denuded area)  or a more chronic phase (blanched, non - bleeding area). 76   Glomerulations (pinpoint  petechial hemorrhages) may be detected on  cystoscopy and can be consistent with IC/BPS  but these lesions are commonly seen in other  conditions which may co - exist with or be mis- diagnosed as IC/BPS such as chronic undiffer- entiated pelvic pain or endometriosis. 77, 78   Glomerulations may also be present in asymp- tomatic patients undergoing cystoscopy for  other conditions. 79   Bladder biopsy may be indi- cated to exclude other pathologies if a lesion of  uncertain nature is present but is not part of  the routine diagnostic process and presents a  risk of perforation.

Pelvic floor  strengthening exercises (e.g., Kegel exer- cises) should be avoided.  Clinical Principle   Discussion.   Many patients with IC/BPS ex- hibit tenderness and/or banding of the pelvic  floor musculature, along with other soft tissue  abnormalities. 19, 66   It is not known whether  those muscular abnormalities are usually pri- mary pain generators (giving rise to associated  secondary bladder pain) or are themselves sec- ondary phenomena elicited by the primary  bladder pain of IC/BPS. Whatever their etiol- ogy, when such soft tissue abnormalities are  present, clinical experience and a limited litera- ture suggest that manual physical therapy can  provide symptom relief. 98 - 102   Very importantly,  there is no evidence that physical therapy  aimed at pelvic floor strengthening (such as  Kegel exercises) can improve symptoms, and  in fact this type of pelvic floor therapy may  worsen the condition. Appropriate manual  physical therapy techniques include maneuvers  that resolve pelvic, abdominal and/or hip mus- cular trigger points, lengthen muscle contrac- tures, and release painful scars and other con- nective tissue restrictions. 103   Unfortunately,  appropriate physical therapy expertise and ex- perience is not available in all communities. In  the absence of appropriate expertise, routine  forms of pelvic physical therapy that are pri- marily aimed at strengthening of the pelvic  floor are not recommended.     No well - designed studies have evaluated  the possible therapeutic role for massage or  other forms of bodywork, though interventions  aimed at general relaxation have proven help- ful in most other forms of chronic pain and  can be recommended to IC/BPS patients.     Guideline Statement 14.       Multimodal pain management ap- proaches (e.g., pharmacological, stress  management, manual therapy if avail- able) should be initiated.  Expert Opinion       Discussion.

American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     29   between PPS (200 mg twice daily) and placebo  patients with statistically similar rates of clini- cally significant improvement in both groups  (56% vs. 49%, respectively). 84   One under- powered trial that included hydroxyzine and  PPS - hydroxyzine arms also reported no statis- tically significant differences on any measured  parameter at six months between PPS (100 mg  three times daily) and placebo patients with  statistically similar proportions reporting im- provement (PPS 28% vs Placebo 13%). 112   The  other two trials by Mulholland and colleagues  (1990) and Parsons and colleagues (1993) re- ported that at three months a significantly  greater proportion of the PPS patients (28%  and 32%, respectively) reported improvement  compared to placebo patients (13% and 16%,  respectively). 114, 115   Both trials administered  100 mg PPS three times daily. The fifth trial  was a randomized crossover design; data from  Phase A (before the crossover) are most useful  because they are free of any effects that may  have persisted into Phase B. 116   This trial re- ported statistically significantly greater propor- tions of patients experiencing improvements in  pain in the PPS group (44%) compared to the  placebo group (15%) with trends in the same  direction for urgency and frequency. One open - label randomized trial without a placebo control  group compared PPS to cyclosporine A and re- ported that CyA patients experienced a statisti- cally significantly higher rate (83%) of clinically  significant improvement compared to PPS pa- tients (21%). 117   The dose - response trial also  lacked a placebo control group and reported at  eight months no differences in proportions of  patients experiencing clinically significant im- provements (300 mg daily  –   50%; 600 mg  daily  –   40%; 900 mg daily  –   45%).     Overall, this relatively high - quality evi- dence demonstrates substantial overlap be- tween proportions of patients expected to ex- perience clinically significant improvement  from PPS (21% to 56%) compared to from  placebo treatment (13% to 49%). A meta - analysis of the five trials that included PPS  and placebo arms revealed a statistically sig- nificant but clinically somewhat weak relative  risk ratio of 1.69 (95% confidence interval =  1.16 to 2.46). Adverse event rates were rela- tively low (10 to 20% of patients), generally  not serious, and similar in treatment and pla- cebo groups. Overall, the Panel judged that  these findings provided some certainty that  the balance between benefits and risks/ burdens on average is relatively equal and  that, similar to other oral treatments, oral  PPS may benefit only a subset of patients not  readily identifiable  a priori . Administration of  oral PPS, therefore, is designated an Option.

                                            <p>1. Purpose:  The purpose of this Guideline is to provide a clinical framework  for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syn- drome (IC/BPS).     Methods:  A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE ®   data- base (search dates 1/1/83 - 7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer - reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS.  Insufficient evidence was retrieved regarding diagnosis; this portion of the  guideline, therefore, is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion.  The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after appli- cation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to cre- ate the majority of the treatment portion of the guideline. When sufficient  evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was as- signed a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Additional  treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion  when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions  and detailed diagnostic, management, and treatment frameworks.      Guideline Statements   Diagnosis:      1.  The basic assessment should include a careful history, physical exami- nation, and laboratory examination to rule in symptoms that characterize  IC/BPS and rule out other confusable disorders (see text for details).  Clinical Principle     2.   Baseline voiding symptoms and pain levels should be obtained in order  to measure subsequent treatment effects.  Clinical Principle     3.   Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics should be considered as an aid to di- agnosis only for complex presentations; these tests are not necessary for  making the diagnosis in uncomplicated presentations.  Expert Opinion     Treatment:     Overall Management:   4.   Treatment strategies should proceed using more conservative therapies  first, with less conservative therapies employed if symptom control is in- adequate for acceptable quality of life; because of their irreversibility, sur- gical treatments (other than fulguration of Hunner‘s lesions) are appropri- ate only after other treatment alternatives have been exhausted, or at  any time in the rare instance when an end - stage small, fibrotic bladder  has been confirmed and the patient‘s quality of life suggests a positive  risk - benefit ratio for major surgery.

                                            <p>34. American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     34   Clinicians and patients are cautioned that the  procedure is indicated for frequency/urgency  symptoms and is much less effective and po- tentially ineffective for pain. 143, 144     Fifth - Line Treatments:          Guideline Statement 20.       Cyclosporine A may be administered as an  oral medication if other treatments have  not provided adequate symptom control  and quality of life or if the clinician and  patient agree that symptoms require this  approach.  Option       Discussion. Cyclosporine A (CyA)  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade C; Balance be- tween benefits &amp; risks/burdens uncer- tain) .   One randomized trial with an oral PPS  group for comparison reported that CyA (3 mg/ kg/day divided into two doses) resulted in 75%  of patients experiencing clinically significant  improvement compared to 19% of a PPS com- parison group after six months of treatment. 118   In addition, 38% of the CyA group reported a  50% decrease in frequency compared with 0%  of the PPS group. Two observational studies  reported similar high rates of efficacy, includ- ing significant pain relief in 91% of patients af- ter six weeks of treatment accompanied by de- creases in frequency and increases in voided  volumes 145   and after an average one year of  treatment, 87% of patients reporting that they  were pain - free with similar improvements in  voiding parameters. 146   In the second study,  some patients had been followed for more than  five years, with continued reports of efficacy as  long as the medication was maintained. 146   In  the randomized trial, adverse event rates  were higher in the CyA arm (94%) than in  the PPS arm (56%), with three serious ad- verse events in the CyA arm (increased blood  pressure, increased serum creatinine) and  one serious adverse event in the PPS arm  (gross hematuria). 118   In the observational  studies, adverse event rates ranged from  30% to 55% and included hypertension, gin- gival hyperplasia, and facial hair growth. 145,  146       Taken together, these data suggest  sustained efficacy; however, because of the  relatively small number of patients treated,  the lack of long - term follow - up data on large  numbers of patients, and the potential for se- rious adverse events (e.g., immunosuppres- sion, nephrotoxicity), the Panel judged some  uncertainty remains in the balance between  benefits and risks/burdens. The decision to  use oral CyA, therefore, is an Option. Clini- cians inexperienced in the use of CyA are  strongly encouraged to seek guidance from a  clinician expert in CyA dosing and patient  monitoring procedures.       Guideline Statement 21.       Intradetrusor botulinum toxin A (BTX - A)  may be administered if other treatments  have not provided adequate symptom  control and quality of life or if the clini- cian and patient agree that symptoms  require this approach. The patient must  be willing to accept the possibility that  intermittent self - catheterization may be  necessary post - treatment.

                                            <p>38. American Urological Association  Interstitial Cystitis     38   preted these data to indicate that BCG treat- ment is not reliably more effective than pla- cebo treatment in the context of potentially  significant adverse events. Life - threatening ad- verse events are possible with exposure to  BCG and have been detailed in the bladder  cancer literature (e.g., sepsis and other serious  adverse events, including death). 170 - 173   For  these reasons, the Panel judged that the risks/ burdens of BCG outweigh its benefits for IC/ BPS patients in routine clinical care situations;  BCG administration in this patient group should  be restricted to investigational settings.       Guideline Statement 25.       Intravesical instillation of resiniferatoxin  (RTX) should not be offered.  Standard       Discussion. Intravesical Resiniferatoxin  (RTX)  (Evidence strength  –   Grade A;  Risks/burdens&gt; Benefits).  Intravesical RTX  demonstrates efficacy similar to placebo; this  treatment should not be offered. This Standard  is based on the findings from two high - quality  RCTs, both of which demonstrated no statisti- cally significant differences between treatment  and placebo groups or between different RTX  dose groups. 174, 175   Adverse event rates were  high (e.g., ranging from 52% to 89%) al- though generally not serious. Given the clear  lack of efficacy and that the most frequently  reported adverse event was pain, the risk/ burdens of this treatment outweigh any bene- fits and it should not be offered to IC/BPS pa- tients.         Guideline Statement 26.     High - pressure, long - duration hydrodis- tension should not be offered.  Recom- mendation.   Discussion. High - pressure, long - duration  Hydrodistension  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade C; Risks/burdens &gt; Benefits) .   High - pressure (e.g., greater than 80 to 100 cm  H20), long - duration (e.g., greater than 10  min) hydrodistension is associated with in- creased frequency of serious adverse events  (e.g., bladder rupture, sepsis) without a con- sistent increase in benefit; this form of hy- drodistension should not be offered. This  Recommendation is based on results of three  observational studies that used high - pressure  (e.g., systolic blood pressure, mean arterial  pressure) and/or long duration (e.g., re- peated intervals of 30 min, three hours con- tinuously). 176 - 178   The efficacy rates from these  studies ranged from 22% to 67% and all re- ported at least one case of ruptured bladder.  Given the lack of predictable efficacy in the  context of serious adverse events, the risks/ burdens of this type of hydrodistension out- weigh benefits; the Panel recommends that  this treatment not be offered.       Guideline Statement 27.       Systemic (oral) long - term glucocorticoid  administration should not be offered.   Recommendation.       Discussion.  Systemic long - term gluco- corticoid administration  (Evidence  Strength  –   Grade C; Risks/burdens &gt;    Guideline Statements 25 — 27    </p>

                                            <p>8. American Urological Association    Interstitial Cystitis    8              Background   tions. A mailed questionnaire study to 1,331  Finnish women aged 17 - 71 identified probable  IC/BPS symptoms in 0.45%. 7   Another ques- tionnaire mailing study to enrollees aged 25 - 80  in a managed care population in the U.S. Pa- cific Northwest identified IC/BPS symptoms in  6 - 11% of women and 2 – 5% of men, depend- ing on the definition used. 8   Investigators in the  Boston Area Community Health study con- ducted door - to - door interviews about urologic  symptoms in a sample of Black, Hispanic and  White individuals aged 30 - 79. 9   They identified  IC/BPS symptoms using six different defini- tions, which yielded prevalence estimates  ranging from 0.6% to 2.0%. Across these defi- nitions, symptoms were typically two to three  times as common in women as men, but no  clear variations were observed by race/ ethnicity. Questions about IC/BPS symptoms  were included in the 2004 version of the U.S.  Nurses Health Study (NHS), which was admin- istered to women aged 58 to 83 years. 10   In this  cohort of women, the prevalence of IC/BPS  symptoms was 2.3%. The prevalence in- creased with age, from 1.7% of those younger  than 65 years up to 4.0% in women aged 80  years or older. In a study of 981 Austrian  women aged 19 - 89 at a voluntary health  screening project in Vienna, the prevalence of  IC/BPS symptoms was determined to be 0.3%  (306 per 100,000). 11   Finally, the RAND Inter- stitial Cystitis Epidemiology (RICE) investiga- tors conducted telephone interviews from a  random sample of over 100,000 households  across the United States. 12   Using validated  case definitions to identify IC/BPS, the esti- mated prevalence in adult women aged &gt;18  ranged from 2.7% (high specificity case defini- tion) to 6.5% (high sensitivity case defini- tion).     Clinician Diagnosis.   Female participants in  the NHS were asked by mailed questionnaires  in 1994 and 1995 whether they had ever  been diagnosed with  ̳interstitial cystitis (not  urinary tract infection)‘. In participants with a  positive response, medical record reviews  were performed to confirm a physician diag- nosis, including cystoscopy performed by a  urologist. Using these methods, the preva- lence of IC/BPS was found to be 52/100,000  in the NHS I cohort, and 67/100,000 in the  NHS II cohort. 13   A subsequent study was per- formed using administrative billing data from  the Kaiser Permanente Northwest managed  care population in the Portland, Oregon met- ropolitan area. 8   Patients with IC/BPS were  identified by the presence of ICD - 9 code  595.1 ( ̳interstitial cystitis‘) in the electronic  medical record, and the prevalence of the di- agnosis was found to be 197 per 100,000  women and 41 per 100,000 men.       Typical Course and Comorbidities . IC/BPS  is most commonly diagnosed in the fourth  decade or after, although the diagnosis may  be delayed depending upon the index of sus- picion for the disease, and the criteria used  to diagnose it. 14   For instance, in European  studies, where more strict criteria are typi- cally used to make the diagnosis, the mean  age is older than is typical for the United  States. A history of a recent culture - proven  UTI can be identified on presentation in 18 - 36% of women, although subsequent cul- tures are negative. 15, 16   Initially it is not un- </p>

For this reason, uncertainty exists in the  balance between benefits and risks/burdens  and surgical treatments are Options.     Substitution cystoplasty.  There are  many potential problems with this procedure,  and it is still debated among IC/BPS experts.  Removing the trigone increases the risk of uri- nary retention, requiring intermittent catheteri- zation. 153   However, a preserved trigone may  be a source for persistent pain and recurrent  ulcers. 154, 155   With regard to patient selection,  the patients most likely to fail are those who  describe the urethra as the main site of  pain, 156   those without Hunner‘s lesions 157   and  those with a larger bladder capacity under  anesthesia 153, 157 - 159 .     Urinary diversion with or without cystec- tomy.  In the properly selected refractory pa- tient, urinary diversion will relieve frequency  and nocturia and sometimes can relieve pain.  If frequency is perceived as a major problem,  then diversion can almost certainly improve  quality of life in select patients who have failed  to respond to standard and investigational in- terventions. However, patients must under- stand that symptom relief is not guaranteed.  Pain can persist even after cystectomy, espe- cially in nonulcer IC/BPS. 157   A published report  of 14 patients who underwent cystourethrec- tomy and urinary diversion revealed 10 pa- tients with persistent pelvic pain including four  with concurrent pouch pain postoperatively. 160   The informed consent process for these pa- tients is critical, and careful counseling about  possible persistent pain is mandatory. Efforts  have been made to predict ahead of time  which patients are most likely to have a good  response. Small bladder capacity under anes- thesia 153, 161   and absence of neuropathic  pain 161   are associated with better response.       Additional Comment: Research Trials.   Even with appropriate therapy many patients  with BPS/IC will not have complete relief of  symptoms. Therefore a large percentage of  patients are potential candidates for clinical  research trials. Clinical research in IC/BPS  has been inhibited by the lack of widely ac- cepted, clear diagnostic criteria. The chal- lenges of designing such trials has been re- viewed by Propert and colleagues. 162   Never- theless, cooperative groups supported by the  NIDDK have completed trials studying in- travesical therapy (BCG), oral therapies  (pentosanpolysulfate/hydroxyzine), amitrip- tyline in treatment naïve patients, and pelvic  floor physical therapy. These studies can pro- vide good templates for future research using  novel agents. Patients should be encouraged  to consider appropriate research trials when  standard treatments provide incomplete relief  of symptoms.       Treatments that should not be offered:  In addition to identifying treatments that ap- pear to benefit a meaningful subset of pa- tients, the Panel also identified treatments  that appear to lack efficacy and/or that are  accompanied by unacceptable adverse event  profiles or other known negative conse- quences. In the judgment of the Panel, the  risks and burdens of the treatments listed be- low outweigh their benefits and they should  not be offered.

Cystoscopy under anesthesia  with hydrodistension  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade C; Balance between benefits &amp;  risks/burdens uncertain).    If first -   and sec- ond - line treatments have not provided accept- able symptom control and quality of life or if  the patient‘s initial symptoms suggest that a  more invasive approach is appropriate, then  cystoscopy under anesthesia with low - pressure  (60 to 80 cm H20), short duration (less than  10 minutes) hydrodistension may be under- taken. Note that the procedure is intended to  serve three purposes. First, before distension,  the bladder is inspected for other potential  symptom causes (e.g., stones, tumors) and for  Hunner‘s lesions. If these are found, then they  are treated appropriately (see below for treat- ment of Hunner‘s lesions). Second, if no blad- der abnormalities or ulcers are found, then the  distension may proceed and serve as a treat- ment. Hunner‘s lesions can be easier to iden- tify after distention when cracking and mucosal  bleeding become evident. Third, distension al- lows for disease ―staging‖ by determining anat- omic as opposed to functional bladder capacity  and identifying the subset of patients who suf- fer reduced capacity as a result of fibrosis.     Three observational studies reported  that one or two exposures to low - pressure,  short - duration hydrodistension resulted in clini- cally significant relief of symptoms for a subset  of patients that declined over time: at one  month efficacy ranged from 30% to 54%; at  two to three months, from 18% to 56%; at  five to six months, from 0% to 7%. 132 - 134   No  adverse events were reported. In the absence  of placebo controls, it is difficult to know the  balance between benefits and risks/burdens.  Given that adverse events appear unlikely  and that the procedure may benefit a subset  of patients, low - pressure, short - duration hy- drodistension is designated as an Option. If  Hunner‘s lesions are detected, then their  treatment is recommended (see below).       Guideline Statement 18.        If Hunner’s lesions are present, then ful- guration (with laser or electrocautery)  and/or injection of triamcinolone should  be performed.  Recommendation   Discussion. Hunner’s lesion fulguration  (Evidence strength  –   Grade C; Benefits &gt;  risks/burdens).  If Hunner‘s lesions are  found, then the Panel recommends that ful- guration (with laser, cautery and/or injection  of triamcinolone) be undertaken. One obser- vational study using diathermy reported at  follow - up intervals ranging from two to 42  months that 100% of patients experienced  complete pain relief and 70% experienced  reduced or normalized frequency. 135   Two ob- servational studies using Nd:YAG lasers  (delivering 15 to 30 watts, pulse duration of  one to three seconds) reported at follow - up  intervals of 10 to 23 months that from 80 to  100% of patients experienced sustained and  clinically significant relief from pain, urgency,  and nocturia. 136, 137   The laser studies suggest  that at follow - up durations up to 23 months,  a large proportion of patients (up to 46%)  may require periodic re - treatment to main- tain symptom control; clinical experience  suggests that this proportion is probably  much higher, particularly at longer follow - up  durations. Patients should be counseled that    Guideline Statement 18   </p>

Long - term oral antibiotic administration  should not be offered.   Standard       Discussion. Long - term Antibiotics  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade B; Risks/ burdens &gt; Benefits) .   One RCT reported that  an 18 - week protocol of sequential antibiotic  administration resulted in 20% of the treat- ment group reporting 50% or greater symptom  improvement compared to 16% of the placebo  group  –   a nonsignificant difference. 163   Adverse  events were typical of long - term antibiotic ad- ministration (e.g., GI disturbances, vaginal in- fections, nausea, dizziness). Using less inten- sive protocols, two observational studies re- ported higher efficacy rates of 45% and  47%. 164, 165   Given the non - significant findings  from the RCT and the potential hazards associ- ated with long - term antibiotic administration in  general (e.g., fostering of antibiotic resistant  organisms), the Panel judged that antibiotic  treatment is contraindicated in patients who  have previously been administered antibiotics  without efficacy and who present with a nega- tive urine culture. This Standard is not in- tended to prevent antibiotic administration to  antibiotic - naïve patients; it is focused on pre- venting repeated or chronic antibiotic admini- stration to patients for whom no relief was ob- tained in an initial course. This Standard also is  not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic  administration (e.g., nightly for several  months) to patients who present with recurrent  UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS be- tween infections.       Guideline Statement 24.    Intravesical instillation of bacillus Cal- mette - Guerin (BCG) should not be of- fered outside of investigational study  settings.  Standard       Discussion. Intravesical Bacillus Cal- mette - Guerin (BCG)  (Evidence Strength  –   Grade B; Risks/burdens &gt; Benefits) .   Intravesical instillation of BCG is associated  with efficacy only non - significantly greater  than placebo in the context of potentially se- rious adverse events with long - term follow - up data indicating no differences between  BCG -   and placebo - treated patients; this  treatment should not be offered. This Stan- dard is based on the results of two RCTs re- ported in four papers. One RCT reported a  non - significantly higher response rate in 15  BCG - treated patients compared to 15 placebo - treated patients (60% vs 27%) at eight  months of follow - up with all patients report- ing one or more adverse event(s). 166   The sec- ond RCT reported in a much larger sample  (131 BCG patients, 134 placebo patients) no  differences in response rate between treat- ment arms (21% in the BCG group compared  to 12% in the placebo groups) at seven  months with 95% of patients in each group  reporting at least one adverse event. 167   Non - responders from both groups were then of- fered open - label BCG and both groups ex- perienced an 18% response rate at seven  months. 168   BCG and placebo responders were  followed for 17 months; 86% of BCG re- sponders and 75% of Placebo responders re- ported themselves to remain improved  –   a  nonsignificant difference. 169   The Panel inter-   Guideline Statement 23 — 24    </p>

American Urological Association    Interstitial Cystitis    10              Background   Challenge to Patient and Clinician: Impact  on Psychosocial Functioning and Quality  of Life (QoL) . The effects of IC/BPS on psy- chosocial functioning and QoL are pervasive  and insidious, damaging work life, psychologi- cal well - being, personal relationships and gen- eral health. 9   QoL is poorer in IC/BPS patients  than in controls. 9, 31, 32   Rates of depression are  also higher. 31 - 33   In addition, IC/BPS patients  have significantly more pain, sleep dysfunction,  catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, stress,  social functioning difficulties and sexual dys- function than do non - IC/BPS age - matched  women. 34, 35   The impact of IC/BPS on QoL is as  severe as that of rheumatoid arthritis and end - stage renal disease. 9, 36   Health - related QoL in  women with IC/BPS is worse than that of  women with endometriosis, vulvodynia or  overactive bladder. 12   Given that IC/BPS causes  considerable morbidity over the course of a pa- tient‘s life and loss of work during the most  productive years of work and family life signifi- cant negative psychological and QoL impacts  are not surprising. 9     Sexual dysfunction has an especially im- portant impact on the QoL of IC/BPS patients.  In IC/BPS patients, sexual dysfunction is mod- erate to severe 37   and occurs at high rates com- pared with controls. 38, 39   In women with treat- ment - refractory IC/BPS, poor sexual function is  a primary predictor of poor mental QoL. 40   Pain  appears to mediate sexual dysfunction and its  associated effects on QoL. Adult women with  IC/BPS report rates of intercourse, desire and  orgasm frequency in their adolescence that are  similar to those reported by controls, but rates  diverge in adulthood, when IC/BPS patients re- port significantly more pain and fear of pain  with intercourse and more sexual distress. 38     The strong link between IC/BPS symp- toms and psychosocial functioning and QoL  make clear the critical importance of optimiz- ing treatment of IC/BPS symptoms. Success- ful treatment of the medical condition clearly  brings improvement in functioning and QoL.  Response to therapy is associated with im- proved overall QoL. 41   In addition, response to  therapy is associated with improved sexual  function and sleep, with concomitant im- provements in QoL. 34, 37       Cost.    Quantifying the economic burden of    IC/BPS on the American healthcare system is  difficult because of the lack of an objective  marker for diagnosis, resulting in uncertainty  regarding its true prevalence. Direct costs as- sociated with IC/BPS are incurred through  physician visits, prescription medications,  outpatient procedures, and hospitalization.  These costs are greater than the mean an- nual per - person direct costs of diabetes melli- tus, depression, hypertension and asthma. 42   They are also more consistent across geo- graphic regions of the United States than  other urologic conditions. 43   Because of the  chronicity of the condition, these costs typi- cally persist over years. The indirect costs of  IC/BPS, including time away from work and  lost productivity while working, are particu- larly significant since the condition primarily  affects working age adults, and especially  women aged 25 - 50 years. The psychosocial  costs such as social, educational and career  related activities not pursued, as well as the  emotional distress, depression, social isola- tion, and diminished QoL have not been  </p>

Pain (including sensations of  pressure and discomfort) is the hallmark symp- tom of IC/BPS. Typical IC/BPS patients report  not only suprapubic pain (or pressure, discom- fort) related to bladder filling but pain through- out the pelvis — in the urethra, vulva, vagina,  rectum — and in extragenital locations such as  the lower abdomen and back. 16, 39, 46   Warren  and colleagues (2006) found that by using  ―pelvic pain‖ as the key descriptor that 100%  of his population fit the case definition. 47   It is  important that the term ―pain‖ encompass a  broad array of descriptors. Many patients use  other words to describe symptoms, especially  ―pressure‖ and may actually deny pain. 46, 48   Fi- nally, pain that worsened with specific foods or  drinks and/or worsened with bladder filling  and/or improved with urination contributed to  a sensitive case definition of IC/BPS. 16     The prototypical IC/BPS patient also  may present with marked urinary urgency and  frequency but because these symptoms may  indicate other disorders, they do not exclu- sively indicate the presence of IC/BPS. Voiding  frequency is almost universal (92% of one  population) 39 , but does not distinguish the IC/ BPS patient from other lower urinary tract dis- orders. Change in urinary frequency is valuable  to evaluate response to therapy but is of little  help in diagnosis. Urinary urgency is also ex- tremely common (84% of the same popula- tion) 39 , but urgency is considered to be the  characteristic symptom of overactive bladder  and thus it can actually confound the diagno- sis. There may, however, be qualitative differ- ences in the urgency experienced by IC/BPS  patients compared to OAB patients; IC/BPS  patients may experience a more constant  urge to void as opposed to the classic ICS  definition of a ―compelling need to urinate  which is difficult to postpone‖. 49, 50   Typically  IC/BPS patients void to avoid or to relieve  pain; OAB patients, however, void to avoid  incontinence. Symptoms of urinary urgency  and frequency may precede symptoms of  pain. 18   Median time to the development of a  full symptom complex of frequency, urgency  and pain was reported to be two years in one  study. 18       Presentation of IC in Male Patients.    His- torically, IC/BPS in men has been considered  relatively unusual with a female to male ratio  of 10:1. 51, 52   However, uncontrolled clinical  series over the past two decades have sug- gested the incidence of male IC/BPS may be  higher than previously observed. 8, 53   IC/BPS  in men is diagnosed by identifying the same  symptom complex that makes the diagnosis  in women. That is, if the man fulfills the crite- ria established by the definition of IC/BPS, he  can be assumed to have the disorder. Early  clinical symptoms may begin with mild dy- suria or urinary urgency. Mild symptoms may  progress to severe voiding frequency, noc- turia, and suprapubic pain. The presence or  absence of glomerulations on endoscopy can  be considered supporting information, but is  too nonspecific to make the diagnosis of the  disease in anyone who does not fit the symp- tom complex as defined.      Clinical findings mirror those of the fe- male IC/BPS patient. On examination, su- prapubic tenderness is common along with  </p>

Initial treatment type and level should depend on symptom severity, clinician judgment, and patient  preferences; appropriate entry points into the treatment portion of the algorithm depend on these fac- tors.   Clinical Principle     6.   Multiple, simultaneous treatments may be considered if it is in the best interests of the patient; base- line symptom assessment and regular symptom level re - assessment are essential to document efficacy  of single and combined treatments.  Clinical Principle     7.   Ineffective treatments should be stopped once a clinically meaningful interval has elapsed.  Clinical  Principle     8.   Pain management should be continually assessed for effectiveness because of its importance to quality  of life. If pain management is inadequate, then consideration should be given to a multidisciplinary ap- proach and the patient referred appropriately.  Clinical Principle     9.   The IC/BPS diagnosis should be reconsidered if no improvement occurs after multiple treatment ap- proaches.  Clinical Principle     Treatments that may be offered:   Treatments that may be offered are divided into first - , second - ,  third - , fourth - , fifth - , and sixth - line groups based on the balance between potential benefits to the pa- tient, potential severity of adverse events and the reversibility of the treatment. See body of guideline for  protocols, study details, and rationales.     First - Line Treatments:   First - line treatments should be performed on all patients.     10.   Patients should be educated about normal bladder function, what is known and not known about IC/ BPS, the benefits vs. risks/burdens of the available treatment alternatives, the fact that no single treat- ment has been found effective for the majority of patients, and the fact that acceptable symptom control  may require trials of multiple therapeutic options (including combination therapy) before it is achieved.  Clinical Principle     11.   Self - care practices and behavioral modifications that can improve symptoms should be discussed and  implemented as feasible.  Clinical Principle     12.  Patients should be encouraged to implement stress management practices to improve coping tech- niques and manage stress - induced symptom exacerbations.  Clinical Principle     Second - line treatments:       13.  Appropriate manual physical therapy techniques (e.g., maneuvers that resolve pelvic, abdominal  and/or hip muscular trigger points, lengthen muscle contractures, and release painful scars and other  connective tissue restrictions), if appropriately - trained clinicians are available, should be offered. Pelvic  floor strengthening exercises (e.g., Kegel exercises) should be avoided.  Clinical Principle     14.  Multimodal pain management approaches (e.g., pharmacological, stress management, manual ther- apy if available) should be initiated.  Expert Opinion     15.  Amitriptyline, cimetidine, hydroxyzine, or pentosan polysulfate may be administered as second - line  oral medications (listed in alphabetical order; no hierarchy is implied).  Options (Evidence Strength -   Grades B, B, C, and B)     16.   DMSO, heparin, or lidocaine may be administered as second - line intravesical treatments (listed in  alphabetical order; no hierarchy is implied).

Cystoscopy under anesthesia with short - duration, low - pressure hydrodistension may be undertaken  if first -   and second - line treatments have not provided acceptable symptom control and quality of life or if  the patient‘s presenting symptoms suggest a more - invasive approach is appropriate.  Option (Evidence  Strength -   Grade C)     18.  If Hunner‘s lesions are present, then fulguration (with laser or electrocautery) and/or injection of tri- amcinolone should be performed.   Recommendation (Evidence Strength -   Grade C)     Fourth - line treatment:     19.   A trial of neurostimulation may be performed and, if successful, implantation of permanent neu- rostimulation devices may be undertaken if other treatments have not provided adequate symptom con- trol and quality of life or if the clinician and patient agree that symptoms require this approach.  Option  (Evidence Strength -   C)     Fifth - line treatments:     20.   Cyclosporine A may be administered as an oral medication if other treatments have not provided  adequate symptom control and quality of life or if the clinician and patient agree that symptoms require  this approach.  Option (Evidence Strength -   C)     21.   Intradetrusor botulinum toxin A (BTX - A) may be administered   if other treatments have not provided  adequate symptom control and quality of life or if the clinician and patient agree that symptoms require  this approach. Patients must be willing to accept the possibility that post - treatment intermittent self - catheterization may be necessary.  Option (Evidence Strength -   C)     Sixth - line treatment:     22.   Major surgery (e.g., substitution cystoplasty, urinary diversion with or without cystectomy) may be  undertaken in carefully selected patients for whom all other therapies have failed to provide adequate  symptom control and quality of life (see caveat above in guideline statement #4).  Option (Evidence  Strength -   C)     Treatments that should not be offered:  The treatments below appear to lack efficacy and/or appear  to be accompanied by unacceptable adverse event profiles. See body of guideline for study details and  rationales.     23.   Long - term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered.  Standard (Evidence Strength -   B)     24.   Intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette - Guerin (BCG) should not be offered outside of investiga- tional study settings.  Standard (Evidence Strength -   B)     25.   Intravesical instillation of resiniferatoxin should not be offered.  Standard (Evidence Strength -   A)     26.   High - pressure, long - duration hydrodistension should not be offered.  Recommendation (Evidence  Strength -   C)     27.   Systemic (oral) long - term glucocorticoid administration should not be offered.
