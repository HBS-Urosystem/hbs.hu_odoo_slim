S UBJECTS  AND M ETHODS Selection of Patients The study population consisted of patients with histologically proven transi- tional cell carcinoma of the bladder who were considered at high risk for tumor recurrence because of the presence of at least one of the following: 1) two or more episodes of histologically proven Ta, Tis, or T1 transitional cell carcinoma (10); 2)  multifocal  bladder  tumors  (defined  as  three  or  more  papillary  tumors present simultaneously or Tis involving at least 25% of the bladder surface area and/or in two or more biopsy sites); and 3) primary or solitary tumors that were more  than  5  cm  in  size,  were  grade  III (11), or  exhibited  DNA  aneuploidy. All patients were registered for randomization within 34 days (mean and median values of 20 days) of transurethral bladder tumor resection, had adequate bone marrow reserve (white blood cell count &gt;4000/mm 3 and platelet count &gt;100 000/ mm 3 ), had adequate renal function (serum creatinine level  2.0 mg/dL or 177  M ),  and  had  a  Karnofsky  performance  score  of  50 – 100.  Exclusion  criteria included prior treatment with mitomycin C within 56 weeks of registration, prior muscle-invasive (T2 – T4) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, concurrent malignancy within 5 years of registration (except for basal cell carcinoma), and pregnancy. Study Protocol Fourteen  academic  and  research  centers  participated  in  the  trial.  The  study protocol  was  approved  by  the  institutional  review  board  of  the  individual study sites. Written informed consent, which detailed the treatments of the two arms,  was  obtained  from  all  patients.  Because  this  trial  was  sponsored  by  the National  Cancer  Institute  (Bethesda,  MD),  we  also  obtained  the  mandated approval from the Office of Protection Against Research Risk of the National Institutes  of  Health  (Bethesda,  MD).  Appropriate  clearance  from  the  State Department (Washington, DC) was also obtained for the non-U.S. sites. Patient randomization and data collection were performed in a central office located at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (Columbus). Patients  were  randomly  allocated  to  one  of  the  two  treatment  arms  by  use  of stratified blocked randomization across 16 (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) strata resulting from four prognostic criteria: 1) presence versus absence of Tis tumor, 2) grade III versus  grades  I  and  II  tumors,  3)  multifocal  versus  unifocal  tumors,  and  4) recurrent versus primary tumors. Information on tumor pathology provided by the treatment site was used for stratification. Within a given stratum, treatment allocation was balanced in 10 patient blocks. Stratification based on prognostic factors was performed to ensure treatment group equability and to obviate the need for post hoc covariate adjustment. The starting date of patient accrual at the 14 study sites ranged from October 1992  to  March  1998.  The  accrual  ended  on  March  23,  1999.  A  total  of  230 patients  were  enrolled  and  randomly  assigned  to  either  the  standard-treatment arm (111 patients) or the optimized-treatment arm (119 patients). Eight of the enrolled patients (three from the standard arm and five from the optimized arm) were  found  subsequently  not  to  meet  the  eligibility  criteria.  Of  the  remaining 222 patients (108 in the standard arm and 114 in the optimized arm), two (one in each arm) had protocol violations; 12 did not complete six treatments because of refusal (one in the standard arm and two in the optimized arm), because of toxicity (two in each arm), or because of other reasons (two in the standard arm and three in the optimized arm); two (one in each arm) refused follow-up; and five (two in the standard arm and three in the optimized arm) had incomplete data. The remaining 201 patients (99 in the standard arm and 102 in the opti- mized arm) were evaluable (Fig. 1). The median follow-up time was 11.7 months as of March 31, 2000. Patients in both arms received six weekly treatments with intravesical mito- mycin  C  dissolved  in  20  mL  of  sterile  water.  Among  the  217  patients  who received  intravesical  chemotherapy,  214  received  mitomycin  C  from  Bristol- Myers  Squibb  (Princeton,  NJ)  and  three  received  mitomycin  C  from  Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). The major differences between the two arms were the higher dose and the manipulations used to maintain a high drug con- centration in the urine in the optimized arm. Patients allocated to the optimized arm were instructed to refrain from drinking fluids for 8 hours before and during intravesical mitomycin C treatment. They were also given oral doses of 1.3 g of sodium bicarbonate the night before, the morning of, and 30 minutes before drug treatment. Just before treatment, a Foley catheter was inserted to empty the bladder. The postvoid residual urine volume was measured by use of a bladder ultrasound instrument (Diagnostic Ultrasound, Redmond, WA) and was reduced, if necessary, by repositioning the catheter and/or by changing the position of the patient.  This  procedure  was  repeated  until  the  residual  urine  volume  was  less than 10 mL. Mitomycin C (40 mg in 20 mL of sterile water) was then instilled intravesically through the Foley catheter by gravity. Drug solution was retained in the bladder for 2 hours. Patients  allocated  to  the  standard  arm  were  not  instructed  to  refrain  from drinking fluids and did not receive oral sodium bicarbonate. In these patients, bladders were emptied via the Foley catheter, but no additional measures were undertaken  to  minimize  the  residual  urine  volume.  These  patients  received  a lower dose of mitomycin C (20 mg in 20 mL of sterile water) that was retained in the bladder for the same 2-hour duration. Fig. 1.

Guillaume Wientjes, Donn C. Young, Jill A. Warner, Pieter L. Venema, David L. Pollifrone, Jeffrey D. Harbrecht, Joseph L. Chin, Seth P. Lerner, Brian J. Miles For the International Mitomycin C Consortium Background: Intravesical  chemotherapy  (i.e.,  placement  of the drug directly in the bladder) with mitomycin C is ben- eficial for patients with superficial bladder cancer who are at high risk of recurrence, but standard therapy is empirically based and patient response rates have been variable, in part because of inadequate drug delivery. We carried out a pro- spective, two-arm, randomized, multi-institutional phase III trial to test whether enhancing the drug’s concentration in urine would improve its efficacy. Methods: Patients with his- tologically  proven  transitional  cell  carcinoma  and  at  high risk for recurrence were eligible for the trial. Patients in the optimized-treatment arm (n = 119) received a 40-mg dose of mitomycin  C,  pharmacokinetic  manipulations  to  increase drug  concentration  by  decreasing  urine  volume,  and  urine alkalinization to stabilize the drug. Patients in the standard- treatment arm (n = 111) received a 20-mg dose without phar- macokinetic  manipulations  or  urine  alkalinization.  Both treatments  were  given  weekly  for  6  weeks.  Primary  end- points  were  recurrence  and  time  to  recurrence.  Treatment outcome  was  examined  by  use  of  Kaplan–Meier  analysis with log-rank tests. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Patients  in  the  two  arms  did  not  differ  in  demographics or  history  of  intravesical  therapy.  Dysuria  occurred  more frequently  in  the  optimized  arm  but  did  not  lead  to  more frequent treatment termination. In an intent-to-treat analy- sis,  patients  in  the  optimized  arm  showed  a  longer  median time  to  recurrence  (29.1  months;  95%  confidence  interval [CI]  =  14.0  to  44.2  months)  and  a  greater  recurrence-free fraction (41.0%; 95% CI = 30.9% to 51.1%) at 5 years than patients  in  the  standard  arm  (11.8  months;  95%  CI  =  7.2 to  16.4  months)  and  24.6%  (95%  CI  =  14.9%  to  34.3%) ( P =  .005,  log-rank  test  for  time  to  recurrence).  Improve- ments were found in all risk groups defined by tumor stage, grade,  focality,  and  recurrence. Conclusions: This  study identified  a  pharmacologically  optimized  intravesical  mito- mycin  C  treatment  with  statistically  significantly  enhanced efficacy. [J Natl Cancer Inst 2001;93:597–604]. Intravesical chemotherapy, as adjuvant to surgical removal of superficial  bladder  cancer,  has  been  shown  to  be  beneficial  in patients at high risk for recurrence (1). However, the selection of  the  drug  and  the  administration  regimen  have  largely  been empiric. We completed a series of studies (2–8) to determine the basis  of  the  incomplete  and  variable  response  of  patients  to intravesical mitomycin C and doxorubicin, evaluating drug sen- sitivity of bladder tumors in patients, plasma and urine pharma- cokinetics in animals and patients, and spatial drug distribution in bladder tissues in animals and patients. On the basis of these studies, we concluded that the variable and incomplete response is partly due to the insensitivity of highly malignant tumors to the  drug  and  partly  due  to  inadequate  drug  delivery  to  tumor cells. The inadequate drug delivery, in turn, is a result of dilu- tion, in part, of the drug solution by residual urine in the bladder, dilution by continuous urine production during the 2-hour treat- ment, and the inability of the drug to penetrate the deep-muscle layers in the bladder. In the case of mitomycin C, instability of the drug in acidic urine is an additional problem. These findings suggested several approaches to enhance the mitomycin  C  concentration  in  urine  and  thereby  to  enhance the  drug  concentration  in  tumor  cells:  1)  increasing  the  dose from the conventional 20 mg to 40 mg, 2) reducing the dosing volume from the conventional 40 mL to 20 mL, 3) minimizing the volume of residual urine at the time of treatment, 4) reducing urine  production  before  and  during  treatment  by  voluntary dehydration, and 5) alkalinizing the urine by use of oral sodium bicarbonate. We used computer simulation to show the pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of such modified intravesical mitomycin  C  therapy (9). On  the  basis  of  the  simulation  re- sults,  we  hypothesized  that  enhancing  drug  delivery  to  tumor cells  would  enhance  the  recurrence-free  fraction  from  20%  to 40% (9). This  study  tested  this  hypothesis  in  an  international,  multi- center,  prospective  phase  III  trial  in  patients  with  superficial bladder cancer who are at high risk for recurrence. The primary objective of the trial was to compare the efficacy of an optimized regimen designed to enhance drug delivery with that of a stan- dard regimen commonly used in the community. The secondary objective was to determine the toxicity of the optimized regimen and to establish factors that may be used to predict response to intravesical mitomycin C therapy.

                                            <p>7. American patients in the two treatment arms indicates that the low response rate in these patients was not due to the difference in the treatment received. D ISCUSSION Intravesical  mitomycin  C  therapy  has  been  used  for  more than  two  decades  as  adjuvant  treatment  of  superficial  bladder cancer.  The  doses  and  treatment  conditions  have  been  based empirically. Multiple studies [e.g., (13,14) ] evaluated different doses  (range,  20 – 60  mg)  and  different  instillation  durations (range, 0.5 – 2 hours). Some of the studies indicate a higher re- sponse rate for treatments by use of a higher dose and/or a longer instillation, whereas other studies do not support this conclusion. The inconsistent results are partly due to the highly variable and incomplete patient response rate and partly due to the relatively small patient sample size of some of the studies, which precludes meaningful statistical evaluation. We have shown (2 – 8) that the variable patient response rate may be due to several physiologic variables  (i.e.,  residual  urine  volume  at  the  time  of  treatment, urine  production  rate,  and  urine  pH),  which  reduce  the  drug concentration in urine and thereby lower drug delivery to tumor cells. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that drug delivery to tumor cells could be enhanced and the response rate could be improved by controlling the physiologic variables and by  increasing  the  dose.  Our  results  demonstrate  that  these changes reduced the recurrence rate and lengthened the median time to recurrence. These improvements in therapeutic efficacy were found for all stratification groups, and they were achieved without  clinically  significant  enhancement  in  toxicity.  On  the basis of these results, we recommend that intravesical mitomy- cin  C  therapy  be  given  under  the  conditions  described  for  the optimized  arm,  i.e.,  a  dose  of  40  mg  at  a  concentration  of  2 mg/mL  in  water,  complete  bladder  emptying  just  before  dose administration, fluid restriction, and oral bicarbonate to alkalin- ize the urine. The standard arm in the present investigation used an induc- tion intravesical mitomycin C therapy that is nearly identical to the  induction  therapy  used  in  the  Southwest  Oncology  Group (SWOG)  protocol  8795.  The  SWOG  study  was  a  randomized prospective  comparison  with  bacille  Calmette-Gue  ́ rin  (BCG) (15). Both protocols used 20 mg of mitomycin C at a concen- tration  of  1  mg/mL  of  water,  and  neither  controlled  residual urine volume, urine production rate, or urine pH. A minor dif- ference was that the maximal time to treatment after transure- thral bladder tumor resection was 14 days in the SWOG protocol but 28 days in this study. The extension was for logistical rea- sons, including waiting for laboratory results, obtaining consent from patients, and waiting for the availability of appointments. The SWOG protocol also used a monthly maintenance therapy with  mitomycin  C.  This  study  did  not  include  a  maintenance therapy because the benefit of maintenance therapy has not been established. The median time to recurrence was 22 months in the SWOG study and 12 months in the standard arm of this study. This difference may be due to the different patient populations in the two studies. This study included patients who had had prior mitomycin  C  and  BCG  therapy,  whereas  the  SWOG  trial  ex- cluded these patients. We speculate that this difference resulted in a worse prognosis for the patients in our study. An unexpected finding in this study was the ineffectiveness of  intravesical  mitomycin  C  therapy  in  African-American  pa- tients. The small number of African-American patients and the unplanned nature of the analysis limit the confidence that can be placed in this finding. Nevertheless, we speculate that a genetic basis for the differential response may exist. Mitomycin C un- dergoes  metabolic  activation  by  quinone  reductases.  The  two major  reductive  enzymes  are  DT-diaphorase  and  cytochrome p450  reductase,  and  laboratory  studies (16 – 25) have  indicated a correlation between the antitumor activity of mitomycin C and the activity of these enzymes. Whether there is genetic variation in  enzyme  activity  or  a  relationship  between  enzyme  activity and treatment outcome is not known and requires further inves- tigation. Intravesical  BCG  is  often  used  as  the  first-line  therapy  for superficial bladder cancer, in part because of its relatively low cost.  Seven  randomized  prospective  clinical  trials  have  com- pared the recurrence rates of bladder cancer after treatment with intravesical mitomycin C with those after treatment with intra- vesical BCG. Three studies (15,26,27) showed intravesical BCG to be superior, whereas four studies (28 – 31) showed no differ- ence. However, the mitomycin C regimens in these earlier trials were not designed to optimize the drug delivery to tumors. For example, in the SWOG protocol 8795, the mitomycin C regimen was similar to the less effective standard arm used in our study. Our results raise the possibility that mitomycin C, when used as described in the more effective optimized regimen, represents a viable alternative to BCG in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. In addition, the relatively low toxicity of mitomycin C, as  compared  with  BCG,  represents  an  important  advantage. Hence, a randomized prospective trial comparing the optimized mitomycin C regimen with BCG is warranted. A PPENDIX Members  of  the  International  Mitomycin  C  Consortium  are  as  fol- lows:  J.

In an attempt to enhance the accrual  of  minorities,  we  included  several  major  metropolitan areas  in  our  study  sites.  Nevertheless,  African-Americans  ac- counted for only 3% of the patients accrued to the study. The risk factors for the six African-American patients (three in each treatment arm) were similar to those for all patients (grade: I/II [four of six patients] and III [two of six]; stage: Ta [four of six patients], T1 [one of six], and Tis [one of six]; focality: unifocal [one of six patients] and multifocal [five of six]; and occurrence: primary [two of six patients] and recurring [four of six]). How- ever,  in  all  of  the  African-American  patients,  the  disease  re- curred in less than 1 year. The difference in the recurrence data between  the  African-American  and  Caucasian  patients  was highly statistically significant (Fig. 3), although the very small number of African-American patients in this unplanned analysis makes  a  conclusion  tentative.  In  the  protocol  design,  race  had not been included as a stratification factor because there were no data to suggest differential responses to mitomycin C by differ- ent ethnic groups. However, the even distribution of the African- Table 6.

Toxicity For patients in the standard arm, the protocol did not call for mandatory  monitoring  of  hematologic  toxicity.  However,  at their physicians ’ discretion, 19 patients in the standard arm were evaluated for hematologic toxicity. Only one patient, who had a history  of  demyelinating  radiculopathy  and  was  receiving weekly  immunoglobulin  treatments,  showed  an  alteration  of white blood cell count (a transient reduction from a pretreatment level of 8100/mm 3 to a level of 3700/mm 3 5 days after the first treatment,  followed  by  a  return  to  4500,  4100,  and  4900/mm 3 during the subsequent three treatments). No hematologic toxicity was observed for the remaining patients. For  patients  in  the  optimized  arm,  the  protocol  called  for the  monitoring  of  hematologic  toxicity  1  week  after  the  first dose of mitomycin C in the first 20 patients to determine whether this  previously  untested  regimen  would  be  associated  with unexpected toxicity. We chose this time point because we had found  previously  that  systemic  drug  absorption  is  maximal after  the  first  dose,  with  nearly  undetectable  absorption  after the  subsequent  doses  and  hematologic  toxicity  takes  several days to become apparent (5). No hematologic toxicity was ob- served  in  the  first  20  patients  treated  in  the  optimized  arm. Hence,  a  mandatory  complete  blood  cell  count  was  discontin- ued.  In  the  additional  31  patients  who  were  monitored  at  the discretion  of  the  treating  physicians,  no  hematologic  toxicity was observed. There  were  minimal  differences  in  nonhematologic  toxicity in the two treatment arms (Table 4). Dysuria was the only toxic effect that was statistically significantly higher in the optimized arm  than  in  the  standard  arm,  but  it  did  not  result  in  a  higher frequency of treatment termination in the optimized arm. (Treat- ment was terminated in one patient each in both arms because of dysuria.) Grade 1 dysuria (mild pain on urination) and grade 2 dysuria  (painful  urination  controlled  by  pyridium)  were  prob- lematic but manageable. Grade 3 dysuria (painful urination not controlled  by  pyridium)  occurred  in  four  patients  in  the  opti- mized  arm  but  in  no  patients  in  the  standard  arm.  Twelve  pa- tients who complained of dysuria or cystitis (two in the standard arm and 10 in the optimized arm) were treated prophylactically with antibiotics for possible urinary-tract infection.

                                            <p>3. Our previous pharmacokinetic study (5) of the mitomycin treatment used in the  standard  arm  has  shown  that  there  is  minimal  systemic  absorption  of  the drug, with plasma concentrations well below the threshold concentration asso- ciated  with  hematologic  toxicity.  Hence,  complete  blood  cell  counts  were not  mandatory  in  the  standard-treatment  arm  and  were  done  at  the  discretion of the treating physician. Because the systemic pharmacokinetics of mitomycin C administered by the optimized-treatment regimen had not been studied pre- viously, the protocol called for mandatory complete blood cell counts in the first 20 patients in the optimized arm 1 week after the first dose was administered (i.e., before administration of the second dose) and, in the absence of toxicity in these 20 patients, termination of this mandate in subsequent patients. As shown in the “ Results ” section, hematologic toxicity was indeed absent. Hence, man- datory  blood  cell  counts  were  discontinued,  and  monitoring  of  hematologic toxicity in subsequent patients was done at the discretion of the treating physi- cian. Samples of urine, serum, and tumors were obtained for companion phar- macologic studies, whose results will be reported elsewhere. Patient Follow-up Patients were followed with cystoscopic and cytologic examination quarterly for  the  first  2  years,  biannually  for  years  3 – 5  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating physician,  and  annually  thereafter.  Investigators  were  encouraged  to  perform a biopsy on suspicious areas for tumor recurrence. Tumors were determined to have recurred when the patient had a positive post-treatment biopsy or a positive cytology.  The  time  to  recurrence  was  defined  as  the  length  of  time  from  ran- domization to the first pathologic or cytologic evidence of tumor recurrence. Patient Evaluability Patients were considered to be evaluable when they completed the six weekly treatments, provided complete treatment and follow-up data, and had no protocol violations. Statistical Analysis As  stated  above,  our  computer  simulation  results (9) predicted  that  the changes adopted in the optimized-treatment arm, compared with the standard- treatment arm, will enhance the recurrence-free fraction from 20% to 40%. By using these predicted values and by assuming exponential failure-time distribu- tion,  a  median  time  to  recurrence  of  13  months  in  the  standard  regimen,  and a 20% nonevaluable rate, we calculated that a sample size of 290 patients, or 116  recurrences,  would  be  required  for  a  two-sided  of  0.05  and  a  power of 0.80. The sample size of 290 was calculated on the basis of a 2-year accrual period  with  final  analysis  in  year  3,  and  the  recurrence  number  of  116  was calculated on the basis of a ratio of 1.7 for the median time to recurrence in the optimized arm to that in the standard arm. Because of a slower-than-expected accrual  rate  and  the  resulting  longer-than-anticipated  follow-up  period,  the 116 recurrences were attained with a reduced sample size of 230 patients. Two interim analyses with O ’ Brien and Fleming (12) -adjusted levels of sta- tistical significance were conducted after accrual of 100 and 200 patients. Nei- ther  interim  analysis  reached  the  necessary  level  of  statistical  significance  for early termination. Hence, patient accrual continued until 116 recurrences were observed. Analysis of the primary endpoint of the time to recurrence was performed by use of Kaplan – Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests. Overall and stratified log-rank tests were used. The proportion of patients free of recurrence at 5 years was also analyzed. Analyses were performed both on an intent-to-treat basis and on  the  evaluable  group.  Comparisons  of  continuous  data  were  performed  by Student ’ s t test, and discrete data were analyzed by use of Fisher ’ s exact tests or chi-square tests. All tests used a two-sided .05 level of significance. R ESULTS Patient Characteristics The patient populations in the two treatment arms were com- parable with respect to demographics (Table 1), disease charac- teristics  used  for  randomization  stratification  (Table  2),  and history  of  intravesical  therapy  (Tables  1  and  3).  The  only  de- mographic variable that approached statistical significance was age ( P  .07); the average age of the patients in the optimized Table 2.
