                                            <p>2. Dear Guests &amp; Friends, It is my pleasure and honour having the chance to organize the Annual Meeting of  ESSIC 2017 in Budapest, Hungary.  This country offers a quite good example of a territory with a low detection rate of  BPS and insufficient cooperation between urologists, gynaecologists and GPs.  Therefore, having the ESSIC meeting in Budapest is a big opportunity for us to  reverse this trend. I am confident Budapest will be a proper venue for this  challenging conference and health professionals will certainly deliver new and  inspiring ideas. ESSIC is furthermore the right organization to discuss, collect and share new thoughts, ideas,  and innovations; new generations of doctors are expected to contribute with alternative and original  proposals in this medical area.  Besides this uniquely inspiring scientific programme, it is worth mentioning that Budapest is a beautiful  capital, with a 2000 year old history; it also offers magnificent buildings and stunning views from both sides  of the Danube. Budapest therefore has all it takes to become for you a pleasurable journey; you may even  end up considering to come back to the city for a long family holiday. Looking forward to welcoming you all  in Budapest on September 2017. Warmest Regards Sándor Lovász ESSIC Meeting Chair 2017 MEETING CHAIR MESSAGE ESSIC PRESIDENT MESSAGE Dear all, I hope to see many of you during the upcoming ESSIC annual scientific meeting in  Budapest, September 21-23 2017. A lot is happening in the world of chronic pelvic pain and bladder pain syndrome.  Several new treatment modalities are under research and much is being learnt from  more extended clinical studies. Many items will be presented and discussed when  we meet. With your help ESSIC is in the process of being built into the World Scientific  Society on these topics. Come and meet the new Board Members and join the discussion also on the administrative and educational  developments. Budapest is a wonderful city and those who have visited before will agree with me. The local host Prof S á ndor  Lov á sz is well known to us and a longstanding authority in the field. So take your agenda and block the dates.  It will be worthwhile. J.J. Wyndaele ESSIC President ESSIC 2017 Abstract Collection  All rights reserved.

The acid in  the  urine  causes  worsening  of  pain,  which  is  rapidly neutralized by urinary alkaliser.    Thus dietary modifications are expected to reduce  the symptoms of painful bladder. Extrapolating the  same,  we  could  identify,  in  a  subset  of  patients,  certain  dietary  initiators  of  urothelial  injury.  Painful frequency of urine has been associated with   newly added ‘herbal tea’ in some individuals.   There is lot of information on Internet as to the  lists  of  dietary  ingredients  that  are  known  to  be  harmful  for  the  patients  with  IC.    However,  neither these lists are comprehensive nor are they  universal. Some individuals would tend to tolerate  the  food  articles  which  others  would  find  injurious.  Hence  these  patients  should  have  a  detailed  interview  to  ascertain  the  possibility  of  diet  related  primary  urothelial  injury  or  dietary  perpetuation   of   pathological   process.   Once  identified, these patients should be encouraged to  build their own diet charts and mark favorable and  unfavorable  dietary  items.    They  should  be  encouraged to share this information in the various   patient groups through social media so that other  patients  could  benefit  from  their  individual  experience.  ________________________________________  7th SESSION | Male BPS     The male patient | R.

ESSIC 2017  - 13-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK  SIXTH SESSION | Specific types of BPS patients       R   replenishment  therapy  might  be  an  effective  treatment for patients with rUTI as well.   On the other hand, the role of microbes in BPS  also has to be reconsidered in light of advances in   modern   microbiology.   Rapidly   increasing  evidence  shows  the  fundamental  role  of  the  complicated  ecosystem  of  human  microbiota  in  our  body:  e.g.  the  gut,  skin  or  vaginal  flora.  Recently,  the  use  of  highly  sensitive  DNA  sequencing  techniques  also  revealed  the  presence  of   urinary   microbiota.   The   term   urinary  microbiota  is  used  for  communities  of  microbes  normally  present  in  the  lower  urinary  tract  of  healthy individuals -  whose urine was previously  considered   sterile   with   standard   culturing  techniques.  Studies  of  different  body  systems  suggest  that  the  microbiota  is  critical  in  the  maintenance of health or development of diseases.  Therefore,  we  have  to  move  forward  from  the  concept  of  sterile  urine  and  re-evaluate  our  knowledge   about   many   different   urological  disorders.  For  example,  it  has  been  shown  that  women  with  BPS  have  a  less  diverse  urinary  microbiota  than  those  without.  However,  the  causality  of  this  relationship  has  to  be  further  elucidated.   These   results   underline   the   importance   of  collaboration  and  joint  research  between  the  experts  of  BPS  and  urological  infectology  and  microbiology. Future studies should aim to deepen  our  understanding  of  the  complex  interactions  between the two research areas.      Role of diet in Bladder Pain Syndrome   Author: Rajesh Taneja   Senior  Consultant,  Urology  Andrology  and  Robotic  Surgery, Indraprastha Apollo hospitals,  New Delhi    _________________________________________    The  urinary  bladder  serves  as  the  final  ‘storage’  reservoir for the metabolic end products of all the   ‘enteral’   feed   that   is   absorbed   across   the  membranes  of  the  digestive  tract.  Therefore,  urinary  bladder  has  been  endowed  with  a  tough  lining,  consisting  of  the  multilayered  transitional   epithelium  and  a  complex  layer  of  Glycosamine  glycans  (GAG),  which  protects  the  bladder  from  the highly concentrated solutes, actively defending   against their back diffusion into body tissues. Thi s  mechanism has been admirably designed by nature  not only  to be impenetrable but also resistant to  insult  and  injury.  However  everything  that  is  meant to be ‘unbreakable’ is actually unbreakable  only within certain limits. This holds true for the   urothelial  barrier  as  well.  Thus,  repeated  assaults   over  prolonged  periods  of  time  by  a  particular  subset  of  urinary  constituents  could  drive  the  impeccability of the urothelial barrier beyond the  limits  of  tenability.  This  would  be  expected  to  result  in  damage  and  consequent  leakage  of  the  constituents   of   the   urine,   initiating   an  inflammatory  response  in  the  tissues  of  urinary  bladder. Since it is the final metabolites of ‘ente ral  absorbable  portion’  of  diet  that  might  determine  the risk of damage to the urothelial barrier, it ca n  be  extrapolated  that  certain  elements  in  the  diet  might  be  harmful  to  the  bladders  in  susceptible  individuals.   There  may  be  three  ways  in  which  dietary  constituents could be involved in the pathogenesis    of Bladder Pain Syndrome   1) Initiating the injury to urothelial barrier. Inj ury  to  the  urothelium  could  occur  by  following  mechanisms.  a)     Direct  assault  on  the  urothelium  by  the  shear  nature  of  the  component  of  urine,  e.g  persistent  intense  acidic  pH  along  with  certain  acidic  catalysts,  which  could  damage  the  GAG  layer of the urothelium.   b)     Allergic  manifestation  in  response  to  the  urinary constituents. The final chemical nature of  the  resultant  solution  after  mixing  of  the  various  excreted metabolites of different dietary items may   be allergenic by way of contact with urothelium.      II)  Perpetuation  of  injury.  Once  the  injury  to  urothelial barrier has occurred, the damage may be  perpetuated  by  repeated  assaults  of  not  only  the  same  urinary  constituents  which  initiated  the  injury  but  also  by  those,  which  were  earlier  incapable of causing injury, and now may become  harmful  due  to  increased  vulnerability  of  the  altered  urothelium.  Thus  perpetuation  of  injury  could occur by two mechanisms  a)     Direct  damage  to  already  vulnerable  urothelium  b)     Seepage of the contents into deeper layers  of  bladder  causing  neurogenic  inflammation  by  exciting pain fibers.  III) Direct nociferous effect of urinary constituen ts  on  the  exposed  nerve  endings  on  damaged  urothelium.   The   simplest   example   of   this  phenomenon  is  dysuria  that  occurs  following  an  endourological procedure.  Taking a cup of strong  coffee  or  a  spicy  meal would  worsen  the  dysuria  while  ingesting  a  urinary  alkaliser    or  tender  </p>

ESSIC 2017  - 12-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK  SIXTH SESSION | Specific types of BPS patients       I  Peters  et  al.  reported  that  vestibulodynia  affects  25% of women with PBS/IC. (3) The etiology of  vulvodynia  is  presumed  to  involve  many  factors:  infections and altered vaginal acidbase balance, an d  the  upregulation  of  pro-inflammatory  immune  responses.  (4)  Furthermore,  a  large  community- based  study  found  that  vulvodynia  was  strongly  associated  with  childhood  physical  or  sexual  abuse.(5)  Because  both  the  vestibule  of  the  vulva  and  the  bladder  are  derived  from  the  urogenital  sinus,  it  could  be  hypothesized  that  the  coexistence  of  vulvodynia   and   BPS/IC   in   some   patients  represents  a  generalized  disorder  of  urogenital  sinus-derived  epithelium.  (6)  From  a  histological  point of view, various noxious stimula could cause  changes  in  the  vulvar  epithelium:  contraction  in  the  pelvic  floor,  and  mast  cells  activation  with  subsequent degranulation and release of histamine.  This  causes  chronic  pain  and  inflammation  through  the  stimulation  of  peripheral  neurons  of  the autonomic nervous system, an upregulation of  the  pain  system,  and  a  possible  shift  from  nociceptive to neuropathic pain. (7) The standard  clinical test for vulvodynia is the cotton swab (Q- tip) test, measuring vulvar pain ratings on a visua l  analog scale. (8)  Several  studies  have  shown  that  gabapentin  has  a  role  as  tricyclic,  yielding  significant  results  in  reducing  pain  perception.  (9)  More  than  80%  of  patients  have  reported  improvements.(10)    More  recently,  botulinum  toxin  has  been  proposed  for  the treatment of vulvodynia. It was found that the  visual analog scale score was reduced from 8.1 to  2.5  (P  &lt;  0.001),  and  eight  (72.7%)  out  of  11  patients were satisfied. (11)  References   1.

Infection and IC   Author: Bela Köves  MD, PhD, Jahn Ferenc South-Pest Hospital, Dept. of  Urology, Budapest, Hungary  ________________________________________    Since Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) and recurrent  urinary  tract  infections  (rUTI)  present  with  very  similar  symptoms,  many  women  with  BPS  are  initially  mistreated  for  UTI  leading  to  late  diagnosis   and   treatment.   Therefore,   correct  differential  diagnosis  is  mandatory  for  patients  presenting with chronic or recurrent symptoms of  painful  and  frequent  urination.  The  diagnosis  of  rUTI  always  has  to  be  established  based  on  microbiologically proven infectious episodes.   Although   BPS   and   rUTI   are   traditionally  considered  separate  diseases,  growing  number  of  evidence suggests that there is a dynamic relation  between the two conditions. The deficiency of the  glycosaminoglycan  (GAG)  layer  was  proposed  to  be  a  risk  factor  for  rUTI,  as  it  creates  ideal  conditions  for  bacteria  to  reach  the  subepithelial  layers of the bladder wall and to form intracellula r  reservoirs     called     Intracellular     Bacterial  Communities   (IBC).   Furthermore,   patients  suffering  from  rUTI  might  develop  a  secondary  GAG  layer  deficiency  as  a  result  of  the  chronic  inflammation caused by their recurrent infections.  Consequently,     intravesical     GAG     layer  </p>

ESSIC 2017  - 5-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK  THIRD SESSION | GAG replenishment  G   chondroitin  sulphate,  pentosane  polysulphate  and  DMSO   included   5   prospective   randomized  controlled  trials  (RCT),  the  remaining  were  classified as uncontrolled clinical studies. The to tal  number  of  patients  included  was  801,  of  which  228 had been evaluated in a RCT. For RCTs, the  largest effect size for symptom reduction as well a s  response  rate  was  observed  for  high  molecular  weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA), with similar  findings in two uncontrolled studies with HMW- HA. The number needed to treat for a response to  intravesical  therapy  was  1.31  for  HMW-HA  and  14.93 for chondroitin sulfate. HMW-HA was also  significantly superior in cost effectiveness and co st  efficacy to all other instillation regimes.  Conclusion:   Despite   the   absence   of   large  randomized studies, current instillation regimes ar e  effective therapies for BPS/IC. Different outcomes  for  presently  available  instillates  have  been  reported. The clinical impact of these observations   has to be evaluated in future.      GAG Layer Replenishment in Bladder Pain  Syndrome   Author: Rajesh Taneja   Senior   Consultant   and   Coordinator,   Urology,  Andrology  and  Robotic  Surgery,  Indraprastha  Apollo  Hospitals, New Delhi, India   ________________________________________    Urinary  Bladder  has  the  difficult  task  of  storing  urine,  a  highly  concentrated  acidic  solution,  against  the  physical  reactions  like  diffusion  and  possible  chemical  reactions  with  the  live  bladder  tissues. This is possible due to the unique structu re  of  urothelium,  which  forms  this  effective barrier.  Glycosamine  Glaycans  (GAG)  layer  is  the  direct  non-living  interface  between  the  superficial  layer  of living transitional epithelium and urine. Thus a s  is  evident,  GAG  layer  happens  to  be  key  component of urothelial barrier. GAG layer faces  the brunt of the harsh nature of urine and hence  has  a  possibility  of  being  ‘consumed’  during  the  period  of  contact  while  storing  urine.  Being  a  product  of  transitional  epithelium,  GAG  layer  needs  to  be  replenished  continually.  Deficient  GAG  layer  can  understandably  result  in  diffusion  of  constituents  of  urine  and  further  damage  to  various layers of the urinary bladder, exposing the   sensory  nerve  endings  generating  pain.  Thus  replenishment of GAG layer is likely to play a key  role in the treatment of BPS of various etiologies     The naturally present GAG substances are   •      Hyaluronic acid  •      Heparin Sulphate  •      Heparin  •      Chondroitin 4 Sulphate  •      Chondroitin 6 Sulphate   •      Dermatan Sulphate   •      Keratan Sulphate    Clinically  available  GAG  replenishing  molecules  are   •      Heparin  •      Pentosan Poly Sulphate   •      Hyaluronic acid  •      Chondroitin Sulphate  •      Combination  of  Hyaluronic  acid  and  Chondroitin Sulphate     Heparin    Heparin is naturally occurring GAG substance and  is quiet inexpensive and readily available. The use   of intravesical Heparin for Bladder pain syndrome  (then   called   Interstitial   Cystitis)   was   first  documented  by  Parson  et  al  (1994).    They  reported improvement of symptoms in 27 out of  46  patients  in  whom  intravesical  Heparin  was  administered in the dose of 10,000 IU three times  a week for three months. Another study by Kuo,  published  in  2001,  reported  improvement  in  urodynamic parameters of 29 out of 40 patients of  BPS   (IC).   All   patients   were   administered  intravesical  Heparin  in  the  dose  of  25,000  IU  twice  a  week  for  three  months.  The  volume  at  first  sensation  had  increased  by  almost  50%  and  there  was  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  t he  total  bladder  capacity  in  awake  condition.  There  was  no  control  group  in  either  of  these  studies.  Heparin has been used as part of various cocktail  regimes  for  intravesical  instillations  by  may  reserchers.     Pentosan Poly sulphate  (PPS)    PPS is a synthetic sulphated polysaccharide that ha s  heparin  like  properties.  It  has  been  believed  to  work by replenishing the damaged GAG layer of  the  urinary  bladder  mucosa,  thus  repairing  the  defective urothelial barrier. Almost 3-6% of orally   ingested drug is excreted unchanged in urine. The  clinical trials have   demonstrated mixed results.  It  is recommended in the dose of 100 mg three times  a day, to be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hour s  </p>

ESSIC 2017  - 10-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK  FIFTH SESSION | Hunner lesions      I  currently  the  most  popular  technique  (8,  9)  but  may  also  entail  problems:  wide  coagulation  enhancing  bladder  contracture  in  an  organ  by  disease  prone  to  develop  scar  contraction.  YAG  laser  is  another  option  of  destruction  of  lesions  (10).  Although  no  complications  were  noted  in  initial series  there have  been  anecdotal  reports  of   bowel  perforation.  Careful  setting  of  energy  parameters is mandatory with laser, too (11).  At  this  stage  there  are  no  comparative  studies  between methods but it is worth noting that in a  recent  large  series  coagulation  did  not  result  in  bladder volume decrease (12) so maybe the risk of  enhancing  bladder  contraction  is  modest;  this  is  still  an  open  question,  though.  There  are  arguments  for  and  against  all  available  methods  with reference to possible risks/advantages related   to the choice of surgical method, like the question   of  bladder  wall  scarring,  postoperative  bleeding,  organ   perforation   and   varying   duration   of  remission after treatment. Sufficiently large studi es  with long-range observation are of interest.   Ablative treatment has stood the test of time and i s  today standard treatment, in clinical practice with   no need of justification as the first line treatmen t of  ESSIC  type  3C;  with  reference  to  efficacy  there  are no comparable alternatives. However, when it  comes to science treatment methods require high  scoring in level of evidence to earn high grades of   recommendation,  and  grading  depends  on  the  outcome of RCTs. Few RTC:s on local ablation  in BPS 3C have been produced but are required.     References   1. Hunner GL. A rare type of bladder ulcer in women ;  report of cases.

IC is BPS with Hunner lesion   Author: Ralph Peeker  Goteborg, Sweden  ________________________________________    The understanding and the perception of the term  “Interstitial  cystitis”  have  undergone  several  important  changes  during  the  past  100  years,  moving  from  a  chronic,  true  inflammatory,  bladder  disorder  to  an  extensive  syndrome  with  pain perceived to be located in the bladder/pelvic  region.  Comments  on  this  development  will  be  presented. From  examples in  the  literature, some  important features of classic interstitial cystitis  will  be outlined. The more inclusive approach during  later decades has drawn desirable attention to the  entire  spectrum  of  disorders  resulting  in  bladder  pain.  The  wish  to  include  all  of  them  into  one  handy  entity  has  unfortunately  resulted  in  much  scientific and clinical confusion, though. It will  be  stressed   that,   originally,   interstitial   cystitis  represented  the  Hunner  type  of  disease.  Today,  there  is  agreement  that  the  classic  type  of  interstitial  cystitis  with  Hunner's  lesions,  bladde r  pain  syndrome  type  3C  according  to  current  terminology,   stands   out   as   a   well-defined  phenotype; it has to evaluated separately in clinic al  studies  and  practice,  as  treatment requirements  as  well  as  response  differ  importantly  between  this  and other phenotypes.    </p>

PhD, Urologist, Rózsakert Medical Center,  Budapest   ____________________________________________    Analysis of the anamnestic data of the 52 IC/BPS  patients diagnosed in the first six months this yea r  proved  that  36/52  (70%)  of  the  patients  had  expressed  urethral  pain  with  or  without  bladder  pain. The level of pain ranged from slight burning  sensation to very heavy, intolerable pain.  It can  be  present  independently  of  urination,  causing  the  sitting,   exercising   and   sexual   intercourse  unpleasant or even impossible.  The  frequently  coexisting  urethral  pain  confirms  the  indication  of  the  catheter-free  instillation,  particularly since this method provides the option  of  simultaneous  treatment  of  the  bladder  and  urethra.   The urethral pain of male IC/BPS patients seems  to be less frequent, but more expressed, than those   in  females.  It  also  shows  a  quicker  response  on  treatment.   Besides   IC/BPS,   many   gynecological   and  urological  syndromes  also  indicate  directly  or  indirectly  pain  in  the  urethra:  the  urethral  syndrome,  vulvodynia,  painful  sexual  intercourse  (dyspareunia),  nonbacterial  chronical  prostatitis,  chronic pelvic pain syndrome.  Interestingly   some   of   these   patients   show  significant  improvement  on  local  GAG  layer  replenishment therapy suggesting that the integrity   of  the  GAG  layer  (leaky  epithelium)  plays  an  important or in even determining role in a portion  of these syndromes.  Symptomatically, but very efficiently can urethral  pain be reduced if concentrated and acidic urine is   prevented by using appropriate alkalizing diet and  dilution of the urine.   We suggest to set up prospective clinical trials to   prove the hypothesis of compromised GAG layer  in syndromes presenting urethral pain. At patients’   selection,  GAG  layer  insufficiency  should  be  proven  by  the  non-invasive,  urinary  diary  based  GAG layer integrity test.  An ESSIC revision of guidelines and definition of  IC/BPS seems to be timely.

Pain can be unprovoked,  varying from constant to intermittent, or occurring   only  on  provocation,  such  in  sexual  intercourse.  The  International  Society  for  the  Study  of  Vulvovaginal Disease defines vulvodynia as “vulvar  discomfort, most often described as burning pain,  occurring  in  the  absence  of  relevant  visible  findings  or  a  specific,  clinically  identifiable,  neurologic  disorder”.  This  “burning  pain”  is  suggestive  of  a  neuropathic  pain  response.  Classification  of  the  vulvar  pain  might  include  localized or generalized pain, or both, provoked or   non-provoked  and  primary  or  secondary.  (1)  Sometimes an area of redness might be visible, but  more  often  the  vagina  and  the  vulva  show  no  abnormalities  on  gynecological  or  dermatological  evaluation.  This  pain  can  affect  women’s  sexual  life, which makes sex painful and, in some cases,  impossible. Women with vestibulodynia are likely  to  have  at  least  two  additional  pain  conditions,  such  as  fibromyalgia,  irritable  bowel  syndrome,  BPS/IC or chronic fatigue syndrome.(2)  </p>

ESSIC 2017  - 34-  ESSIC 2017   ABSTRACT BOOK   TENTH SESSION | Summary of Roundtables   The term IC implies an inflammation within the  wall  of  the  urinary  bladder,  involving  gaps  or  spaces  in  the  bladder  tissue.    This  does  not  accurately  describe  the  majority  of  patients  with  this  syndrome.    Painful  Bladder  Syndrome,  as  defined by the International Continence Society, is   too restrictive for the clinical syndrome.    Properly defined, the term Bladder Pain Syndrome  appears  to  fit  in  well  with  the  taxonomy  of  the  International  Association  for  the  Study  of  Pain  (IASP)  (see  below),  and  focuses  on  the  actual  symptom complex rather than what appears to be  long-held   misconception   of   the   underlying  pathology.    Bladder Pain Syndrome (XXIII - 2)  (per IASP)   Bladder  pain  syndrome  is  the  occurrence  of  persistent  or  recurrent  pain  perceived  in  the  urinary  bladder  region,  accompanied  by  at  least  one other symptom, such as pain worsening with  bladder  filling  and  day-time  and/or  night-time  urinary frequency. There is no proven infection or  other  obvious  local  pathology.  Bladder  pain  syndrome  is  often  associated  with  negative  cognitive,   behavioral,   sexual,   or   emotional  consequences as well as with symptoms suggestive  of lower urinary tract and sexual dysfunction.  The  Consultation  believes  that  based  on  the  pathology and endoscopic findings characteristic of   the Hunner lesion, the epidemiologic pattern that  distinguishes  it  from  bladder  pain  syndrome,  the  clinical response to local treatment of the lesion  by  resection,  fulguration,  or  steroid  injection,  the  response  to  cyclosporine,    and  the  absence  of  reports in the literature that non-Hunner patients  go on to develop Hunner lesions (ie, the finding of   Hunner lesion does not represent a continuum in  the natural history of bladder pain syndrome ), the  presence  of  a  Hunner  lesion  should  be  considered a distinct disea se .  It therefore should  drop out of the bladder pain syndrome construct,  much  like  we  do  not  consider  other  painful  conditions like radiation cystitis, ketamine cystit is,  or  urinary  tract  infection  a  part  of  bladder  pain  syndrome.   The  Consultation  concludes  that  it  would  be  reasonable  to  designate  the  Hunner  lesion  in  symptomatic  patients  with  the  term  “interstitial  cystitis”,   thus   indicating   a   true   interstitial  inflammation.    It  would  be  defined  much  as  Hunner  defined  it  100  years  ago,  and  harmonize  to a great extent the Asian, European, and North  American  concepts  of  interstitial  cystitis.    The  Consultation  will  continue  to  refer  to  the  symptom  complex  as  “bladder  pain  syndrome”.   Hunner  lesion  will  be  considered  a  distinct  phenotype, but in the future may be classified as a   separate  disorder  entirely,  albeit  with  local  symptoms  that  are  difficult  to  differentiate  from  bladder  pain  syndrome  in  the  absence  of  endoscopy.    In  other words,  we may  be  coming  full circle in the historical perspective.      2. His tory / Initial Assessment   Males  or  females  whose  symptoms  meet  the  requirements  of  the  definition  of  bladder  pain  syndrome  should  be  evaluated.    The  presence  of  commonly  associated  disorders  including  irritable  bowel  syndrome,  chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  and  fibromyalgia  in  the  presence  of  the  cardinal  symptoms of bladder pain syndrome also suggests  the  diagnosis.    Abnormal  gynecologic  findings  in  women and well-characterized confusable diseases  that may explain the symptoms must be ruled out.  The    initial    assessment    consists    of    a  frequency/volume    chart,    focused   physical  examination, urinalysis, and urine culture.  In the   absence  of  confusable  disorders  (uncomplicated  disease),  a  diagnosis  can  be  made  and  treatment  instituted.    Urine  cytology,  cystoscopy,  and  urodynamic  evaluation  are  recommended  if  clinically indicated and/or the diagnosis is in dou bt  (complicated  disease).    Patients  with  urinary  infection should be treated and reassessed.

Their  function  is  an  accurate  selection  of  any  molecule  they  encounter:  if  harmless or useless, molecules can be neutralized,  eliminated,  absorbed  and  transformed  to  make  them  usable.  Epithelia  are  an  integral  part  of  the  sensory web.           The urothelium with a special GAG-layer enables  the storage of urine with a high osmotic gradient  to  the  blood.  The  surface  cells  are  covered  by  a  glycosaminoglycan  layer  (GAG).  The  function  of  the GAG layer is controversial. Suggested tasks are   an  osmotic  barrier  function    against  small  molecules  (urea),  prevention  of  the  formation  of  microcrystals  in  urine  (nucleation),  neutralization   of    toxic  substances  and  providing  a  significant  antibacterial  protection  by  interfering  with  uro- pathogen adhesion           Part  of  the  urothelium  are  an  “umbrella  “cell  coating  and  some  classes  of  membrane  proteins.  There  is  a  high  osmotic  and  chemical  gradient  between the urine and the blood plasma. Amongst  others the GAG-layer protects the passage of urine  into  the  lamina  muscularis.  Also  in  normal  conditions there is a permeation of substances from   the urine into the plasma, as for water and urea.           The coating is thin, soft and flexible, not compact   with material. It can be visualised under electron  microscopy. It needs, when optical microscopy is  used,  special  fixation  techniques  to  avoid  its  solubilisation. It  can  be seen  in  vivo by  confocal  microscopy   and   coating   binding   fluorescent  probes.           Though  the  presence  of  a  GAG-layer  has  been  confirmed biochemically and histochemically, few  rigorous characterizations have been performed.  It   has been shown  that the GAG content of human  bladder  epithelium  can  be  readily  and  accurately  characterized from cold-cup biopsy samples..           The  biochemical  and  histochemical  structure  of  the   GAG-layer   will   be   given  during  the  presentation.   There   exist   several   different  components,   each   with   specific   functions,  interactions,  and  possible  mechanisms  of  giving  dysfunction.

Mast cells   Author: Jorgen Nordling  University of Copenhagen, School of Medicine, Denma rk     _____________________________________     Mast  cells  have  classically  been  related  to  allergi c  responses. However, several recent studies indicate   that  these  cells  essentially  contribute  to  other  common diseases. Their residence at the border of  the  body  and  environment,  combined  with  their  array  of  diverse  mediators  suggest  that  they  are  strategically  situated  to  innate  immune  and  inflammatory   responses.   In   such   locations,  including  the  bladder  wall,  mast  cells  are  well  placed  to  function  in  host  defence  (Galli  et  al.,  1999).  Mast  cells  participate  in  many  biological  responses including allergic diseases, host respons es  to parasites and neoplasms, blood vessel formation,   acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, fibrotic  conditions,  tissue  modelling  and  wound  healing  (1).  Locally,  mast  cells  may  influence  many  of  these processes through the production of a broad  spectrum  of  multifunctional  mediators,  especially  proinflammatory  cytokines  (1-4).  Their  central  role in immunological processes is further reflecte d  by the large number of mediators by which mast  cells  may  influence  other  cells.  The  same  feature  that enables mast cells to protect the organism can   run  out  of  control  resulting  in  disease  instead  of  host protection.   Mast cells are known to be the primary responders  in allergic reactions, orchestrating strong respons es  to  small  antigens.  Mast  cells  are  coated  with  antigen-specific  IgE,  and  exposure  to  specific  antigens  induces  bringing  of  surface  bound  IgE  molecules resulting in a rapid release of preformed   mediators from granules, as well as the release of  the  de-novo  synthesized  mediators,  which  all  act  </p>

Birder   Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, University of Pittsbu rgh  _____________________________________     There is evidence that functional pain syndromes  such  as  interstitial  cystitis/bladder  pain  syndrome   (IC/BPS)  are  associated  with  alterations  in  the  urothelium. The urothelium, which lines the inner  surface  of  the  renal  pelvis,  ureters  and  urinary  bladder, not only forms a high-resistance barrier t o  ion, solute and water flux, and pathogens, but also   functions  as  an  integral  part  of  a  ‘sensory  web’  which receives, amplifies and transmits information   about  its  external  milieu.  These  cells  actively  communicate with bladder nerves, urothelial cells,  smooth muscle and even cells of the inflammatory  and immune systems.  The localization of afferent  nerves  next  to  the  urothelium  suggests  that  urothelial  cells  could  be  targets  for  transmitters  released  from  bladder  nerves  or  that  chemicals  released  by  urothelial  cells  could  alter  afferent  nerve excitability in additional to influencing oth er  cells.    Though  mechanistic  differences  are  certain  to  exist,  a  number  of  visceral  disorders  including  IC/BPS  also  share  increased  stress responsiveness,  as  a  pathophysiological  factor.    Reports  of  abnormalities  in  vasomotor  tone  and  increases  in  bladder  sympathetic  nerve  density  and  urine  norepinephrine  secretion  in  both  humans  with  IC/BPS and in animal models are consistent with  altered noradrenergic function, including increased   stress  responsiveness.    Studies  in  animals  with  experimentally   induced   disease   also   have  documented  that  stress-sensitization  is  associated  with  a hyperalgesic  state similar  to  that  exhibited   by  many  persistent  pain  syndromes.  Moreover,  environment  enrichment  has  been  shown  to  reduce   lower   urinary  tract   and   co-morbid  symptoms in cats with feline interstitial cystitis  and  in  clinical  studies,  further  supporting  a  role  for  abnormalities of the stress response system playing   a role in the pathophysiology of IC/BPS.      In addition, stress has been linked to disturbances   of  the  epithelial  barrier  in  a  number  of  tissues.   Reports  in  both  healthy  human  volunteers  and  animals  show  that  excessive  exposure  to  stress  results in an abnormal epithelial response to stimu li  that can impair the barrier function. Alterations o f  the urinary bladder urothelium at both molecular  and structural levels have been detected in patient s  and animals diagnosed with IC/BPS similar to that  in animals exposed to chronic psychological stress.   The epithelial damage and dysfunction reported in  IC/BPS  may  be  due  to  augmented  urothelial  release  of  mediators  including  reactive  oxygen  species and inflammatory factors, which have been  shown  to  be  elevated  in  IC/BPS  animals  and  patients  and  can  be  triggered  by  increased  stress.  Further, defects in epithelial response to stimuli  in  a number of tissues including the urinary bladder  may  lead  to  the  development  of  a  persistent  mucosal  dysfunction  and  increased  susceptibility  for   symptom   flares.   Taken   together,   both  physiological and psychological stress can result i n  a  failure  of urothelial  and sub-urothelial ‘defense ’  systems  and  thereby  promote  changes  in  both  urothelial barrier and signaling functions that cou ld  trigger symptoms of urgency, frequency and pain  during bladder filling and voiding.  _____________________________________    2nd SESSION | Roundtable on ESSIC  guidelines   Shortcomings and what should be  changed/improved  Moderators: J Nordling, P Hanno, M Fall, JJ  Wyndaele    </p>

He  found  that  (open)  resection  of  such  lesions  was  a  means  to  obtain  symptom  remission  but  since  improvement  was  mostly  short-lived  he  gave  up  this  treatment.  Transurethral resection (TUR) was on trial in the  seventies (2, 3) but this kind of surgery did not g et  acceptance. Our first series was published 1985 (4) .  Our  rationale  of  TUR  was  twofold:  to  obtain  sufficient tissue to permit a reliable and sufficie ntly  detailed histo-pathologic diagnosis, and to establi sh  if  careful  resection  of  lesions  actually  could  help   patients. At this stage there was as much skepticis m  as before, with questions like: if you assume that  an ulcer causes symptoms and you by an operation  create an even bigger ulcer, how is it possible tha t  such  a  measure  could  make  any  improvement?  There  are  reasonable  explanations  for  efficacy  of  surgery, though. The operation  causes peripheral  denervation  with  removal  of  inflamed  nerve  endings,  reduction  of  aggregates  of  potent  inflammatory  mediators  and  elimination  of  epithelia l  mast  cell  (MC)  recruiting  factors,  as  well  as  epith elial  and  subepithelial  MS:s,  which  might  cause  disease  remission  (4,  5).  In  this  context  it  is  worth  remembering   that   perineural   localization   of  inflammatory cells is a very typical feature in cla ssic  interstitial  cystitis  (6).  In  addition,  early  repor ts  suggest that MCs are innervated (7) and anatomical  proximity  of  MC:s  to  nerve  fibers  underpin  the  likelihood of functioning neuro-immune interfaces  significant for the development of symptoms.   A  well-known  complication  of  classic  IC  is  bladder  scarring  and  contracture.  The  TUR  electrical settings should be on the lowest intensi ty  possible, still effective for resection, with only  pin- point  coagulation  of  bleeding  vessels  and  no  coagulation over large surfaces, with the intention   to minimize development of scar tissue that could  promote  bladder  contracture  (4).  That  can  make  the operation technically challenging and now and  then   also  time-consuming   since,  based   on  experience,  it  is  important  to  identify  all  lesions   and  remove  all  involved  areas  including  the  peripheral edema zone; completeness is crucial for  the  result.  That  is  a  limitation  of  TUR  since  it  takes  a  very  experienced  transurethral  surgeon  to  perform mostly multiple, wide resections over the  entire bladder area, typically including the dome,  on  sometimes  very  thin-walled  bladders.  Bladder  perforation  is  certainly  a  risk,  although  rarely  experienced (4, 5). The hitherto largest series (5)   confirm  the  remarkable  efficacy  of  TUR  in  BPS  type  3C,  92  of  103  patients  having  remission  of  symptoms  after  TUR,  and  long-term  relief,  making    surgery    worthwhile.    Cystoscopic  coagulation  of  lesions  is  technically  easier  and  </p>

ESSIC 2017  - 4-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK  THIRD SESSION | GAG replenishment  W   P  Why     would     we     use     GAG  replenishment/pathophysiological  background   Author: Jean-Jacques Wyndaele  University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium  _________________________________________________    GAG  replenishment  is  an  important  way  of  treatment  of  BPS/IC  patients  today.  There  exist  different   products,   different   combination   of  products. The results are acceptably good though  the optimal practical application remains uncertain   as well as why it works.  Urothelial dysfunction, which can be quantitative  and/or  qualitative,  means  an  abnormal  sensory  web function.  Dysfunction  can  be  experimentally  induced  by  protamine,  which  gives  rapid  disappearance  of  coating,   alters   cytoskeleton   arrangement   of  umbrella cells, and destabilization of the basolate ral  barriers with a direct impact on junction proteins.    Identification    of  a  specific  etiology  in  a  clinica l  situation is quite difficult, because of the very l arge  numbers   of   involved   genes.   For   coating  deterioration,  because  it’s  very  complex  structure  under high interaction  by  macromolecules, it is  extremely difficult to define a time sequence or a  priority order in the deterioration.  Significant  changes  that  have  been  demonstrated  are  rather  in  the  amount  of  glycoproteins  rather  than proteoglycans. Chondroitin sulphate level was  shown  in  historical  studies  to  be  markedly  reduced. More sensitive methods showed however  that all components are affected.   Coating  modification  can  induce  an  increased  potassium  flow  in  urothelial  cells  and  influence  other  functionally  important  membrane  proteins  compromising  the  permeability  of  the  umbrella  cell apical portions. Crucial is the drastic reduct ion  of  GAG  binding  functional  glycoproteins.  The  existence  of  repair  deficiency  has  been  shown,  while  an  alternative  differentiation  state  of  the  urothelium has been suggested.  Studies  have  shown,  with  a  quantitative  in  vivo  method  of  measuring  bacterial  adherence,  that  bacterial  adherence  to  the  mucosal  cells  is  diminished  in  the  presence  of  this  GAG,  rises  when  GAG  is  artificially  removed  (by  acid),  and  returns to normal when the GAG is resynthesized.   Addition  of  exogenous  GAG  (heparin)  to  the  bladder  prevented  the  expected  rise  in  bacterial  adherence.  Autoradiography  revealed  the  heparin  to  be  adherent  to  the  surface  of  the  transitional  cells.  An   animal   study   used   fluorescent   labelled  chondroitin  sulphate  to  track  the  distribution  of  GAGs administered intravesically to mouse bladder  that  had  been  damaged  on  the  surface.  GAG  administered intravesically  was shown to bind to  the damaged bladder. Given that the changes seen  following  bladder  damage  resemble  those  seen  naturally  in  BPS/IC  ,  the  mechanisms  proposed  for the action of these agents is consistent with a   coating of damaged bladder.  The structure of GAG and the way external GAG  may  help  to  restore  function  will  be  discussed  during the presentation.    References   Kyker  KD,  Coffman  J,  Hurst  RE.

Phenotyping  of  Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder  Pain Syndrome   Author: Yr Logadottir   University of Gothenburg, Sweden  ___________________________________     Bladder  Pain  Syndrome/Interstitial  Cystitis  is  a  complex syndrome. The etiology and pathogenesis  are  unknown  and  there  are  probably  multiple  causative factors. The diagnosis is mainly made by  excluding   other   diagnosis/causes   (confusable  diseases) but there are some positive factors as we ll  (1, 2). The clinical presentation is characterised  by  urinary  frequency  and  pain  when  filling  the  bladder.  All  evidence  points  to  the  existence  of  two main phenotypes, BPS with Hunner ́s lesion  (Classic  Interstitial  Cystitis,  ESSIC  type  3C)  and  non-Hunner   BPS   (previously   non-ulcerous  Interstitial  Cystitis).  Even  though  they  share  a  similar  symptomatology  and  a  similar  chronic  course,  they  differ  in  in  a  number  of  respects.  Phenotyping is therefore the first and crucial step   in BPS/IC diagnostics.  In  our  clinic  at  the  University  Hospital  in  Gothenburg  we  have  a  routine  procedure  in  evaluating  symptoms  and  when  examining  the  patients.   This   includes   micturition   diaries,  questions  on  previous  symptoms  and  other  diagnoses, evaluation of quality of life etc. The f irst  step of the clinical examination is office cystosco py  with  thorough  palpation  of  the  pelvic  organs  including  the  pelvic  floor  for  possible  trigger  points, inspection of the urethra and the bladder a t  varying filling states, with a note on the degree o f  filling  causing  pain.  Inspection  of  the  bladder  mucosa  during  filling,  at  maximal  filling  and  during  a  second  filling,  to  see  if  Hunner  lesions  appear, is mandatory. Later the patient is examined   during full anaesthesia with bladder distension and   measurement  of  maximum  capacity.  Biopsy  is  performed by transurethral resection of all lesions .  It  is  our  experience that relevant  phenotyping in  BPS/IC  is  with  no  doubt  the  most  important  factor  for  success  in  the  individual  patient,  and  certainly  for  research  on  causative  factors  and  results  of  treatment.  This  is  not  easy  since  many  syndromes and phenotypes hide themselves under  the  label  non-Hunner  BPS.  On  the  other  hand,  Hunner  disease  stands  out  as  a  well  definable  condition. The histological findings are distinctiv e;  cystoscopy is unfailing, at least for the trained e ye.  Another  discriminative  point  is  the  extreme  production  of  nitric  oxide  (NO)  in  ESSIC  type  3C,  whereas  the  non-Hunner ́s  BPS  does  not  show any inflammation, no increase in mast cells  and  no  production  of  NO  (3).  Treatment  responses are differing in many aspects. Important  is  that  major  operations  in  patients  with  non- Hunner disease should be avoided, simply because  they  do  not  benefit  the  patient,  whereas  reconstructive   operative   treatment   does   so,  especially  in  patients  with  end  stage  ESSIC  type  3C  (4).  Differences  are  valid  for  many  other  treatment modalities, too.     References   1. Gillenwater JY, Wein AJ.

ISBN:  978-0-9569607-3-3  ______________________________________   Definition    Bladder  Pain  Syndrome  (in  the  absence  of  a  universally  agreed  definition,  the  International  Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis –ESS IC  definition is given  (1)   ESSIC:  Chronic   pelvic   pain,   pressure   or  discomfort  of  greater  than  6  months  duration  perceived  to  be  related  to  the  urinary  bladder  accompanied  by  at  least  one  other  urinary  symptom  like  persistent  urge  to  void  or  urinary  frequency.  Confusable diseases as the cause of the   symptoms must be excluded.    There is no published data as to what duration of  symptomatology  indicates  that  early  spontaneous  resolution of symptoms is unlikely.  While ESSIC  arbitrarily uses a 6 month duration, the American  Urological Association Guideline suggests 6 weeks  is long enough to initiate diagnosis and treatment  of  BPS.    (2)    Without  further  data,  the  Consultation cannot make a recommendation and  believes  that  it  is  up  to  the  discretion  of  the  physician  and  patient  as  to  the  proper  interval  between  symptom  onset  and  evaluation  and  diagnosis of a chronic condition.  Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS)   1. Nomenclature    The  scientific  committee  of  the  International  Consultation voted to use the term “bladder pain  syndrome”  for  the  disorder  that  has  been  commonly  referred  to  as  interstitial  cystitis  (IC).    The  term  painful  bladder syndrome  was  dropped  from the lexicon.   </p>

Which is the easiest and optimal way to  follow up our patien ts   Author: Sándor Lovász  MD. PhD, Urologist, Rózsakert Medical Center,  Budapest   __________________________________________    There is an urgent need for an easy to use and the  everyday praxis facilitating solution for a long-ti me  follow-up system.  We  present  a  home  site  dedicated  to  newly  diagnosed  IC/BPS  patients.  They  fill  in  all  quantitatively   measurable   parameters   already  before  any  treatment.  Patients  are  then  regularly  sending these parameters over the Internet, and a  central  database  is  being  built  up.  The  therapist  and  the  patient  herself  can  have  a  look  at  the  course  of  the  measured  parameters  any  time,  presented on graphs in real time.   The visual feed back of the graphs makes patients’  state  more  transparent  and  let  slow  changes  and  tendencies become evident, letting us correct the  treatment protocol accordingly.   This follow-up system let us continuously monitor  patients’  condition  and  individually  tailor  the  frequency  of  instillations  and  the  composition  of  the  used  cocktails.    It  also  let  the  doctors  keep  contact with the patients in cases of self-treatmen t  even over significant geographic distances.  The  centrally  collected  data  base  makes  statistical   evaluation any time possible.      Patient groups: the way forward   Author: Jane M. Meijlink  International Painful Bladder Foundation  ________________________________________    In  the  past  2  decades,  major  changes  have  taken  place  in  the  field  of  patient  support,  advocacy,  empowerment  and  patient  involvement  in  the  field  of  healthcare  in  the  widest  sense.  Support  groups are needed more than ever before because  the   community   care   network   has   largely  disappeared  in  the  developed  world;  family  members are no longer close by; working partners  are rushed off their feet and have no time for care   duties and since people are today far more mobile,  neighbours keep moving. Furthermore, the family  doctor  has  often  been  replaced  by  anonymous  primary care clinics; home visits are now only for  dire  emergencies;  the  qualified  district  nurse  has  largely disappeared while cutbacks in care have led   to home care services being pared to a minimum.  All  of  this  means  that  chronically  ill  people  are  often left to fend for themselves when they are in  no  condition  to  do  so,  and  may  feel  and  be  isolated  from  society.  Contact  with  a  support  group can help to fill some of the gaps. Today, the   picture has been greatly changed by the rise of the   internet which in a relatively short time has given   support groups far more possibilities and provided  patients with all kinds of online forums for contac t.  It has also given patients around the globe access  to  the websites of groups worldwide. But one of the  biggest  changes  is  that  the  internet  has  also  provided   patients   with   access   to   medical  knowledge  and  to  the  latest  scientific  research  in  the field of their disorder. Add to this the fact t hat  today many more patients and their advocates are  very  well  educated,  and  you  have  the  emerging  phenomenon  of  the  “expert  patient”  and  the  “expert  advocate”  who  are  fully  up-to-date  with  scientific research and attend medical conferences  in  their  field.  This  rise  of  the  expert  patient  is  already changing the face of the healthcare world  and will likely do so far more in the future. These   social  developments  mean  that  advocacy  at  all  levels is today an important aspect of the work of  support  groups  and  their  umbrella  organizations.  In order to meet the needs of today’s world and to  comply  with  current  and  future  requirements  of  e.g. research funding authorities, it is essential  for  societies  such  as  ESSIC  to  work  closer  with  the  very active patient organizations in this field and  to </p>

Responses to various treatments differ between  phenotypes.  A   few   examples :   Pentosan  polysulphate . In an early, open study, patients with  the  non-  Hunner  type  of  disease  seemed  to  be  better   responders   than   HL   patients   (14).  Cyklosporine  A.   In  a  study  comparing  natrium  pentosan    polysulphate    and    cyclosporine,  Cyclosporine A resulted in a high success rate for  patients with HL while the success was limited in  patients  without  Hunner  lesions  (15).  TENS   is  a  simple, cheap and non-destructive means to treat  BPS. In an open study the response rate was found  to  be  much  better  in  patients  with  the  classic  Hunner type of disease compared to non-Hunner  subjects  (16).  Transurethral  ablation  techniques   have been advocated since many years (17). In the  largest  series  so  far  (18),  comprising  103  patients   with  HL  (ESSIC  type  3C),  a  satisfactory  symptomatic  effect  was  seen  in  9  of  10  patients.  Surgical destruction of lesions is applicable in th is  phenotype  only  and  that  goes  for  sub-lesion  injection of cortisone  as well (19).  Major surgery :  Patients  with  a  small  anaesthetic  bladder  capacity  have  been  found  to  be  better  candidates  for  bladder reconstruction.  In fact, patients with end - stage  Hunner  disease  have  very  favourable  results  with   major   surgery   (20-22).   The   results,  irrespective  of  method,  is  little  encouraging  in  other   presentations   of   BPS/IC   (21)   but  experiences differ from centre to centre.                                        Markers for HL   are on their way :  The discovery  of  excessive  nitric  oxide  evaporation  from  the  bladder in BPS type 3C provides a new diagnostic  tool (23). NO has been shown to be elevated in  well-defined  inflammatory  disorders,  such  as  in  asthmatic  disease  (24),  and  in  colitis  (25),  and  is   dramatically increased in 3C (26), in fact diagnost ic  all  by  itself.  A  further  option  has  emerged  -  determination  of  macrophage  inhibitory  factor  (MIF).  Urine  MIF  is  elevated  in  bladder  inflammation, and markedly so in patients with 3C  in contrast to non-Hunner subjects. MIF may serve  as  a  non-invasive  biomarker  to  select  BPS/IC  patients  who  need  cystoscopy/bladder  distension  (27).    Conclusion   Multiple studies indicate that HL/3C differs from  other  presentations  of  BPS,  with  reference  to  many facts. Among other things that includes age  at  presentation,  cystoscopic  findings,  bladder  capacity, histologic presentation including mast ce ll  expression,  neurobiological  findings  and  response  to various treatments (28). There is unquestionable   evidence that the Hunner type of disease (ESSIC  type  3C)  represents  a  separate  and  well-defined  entity, to be dealt with accordingly.    References   1 . Hunner GL.

PhD, Urologist, Rózsakert Medical Center,  Budapest   ________________________________________    We sum up our usual strategy of diagnosis, therapy  and follow up in female and male patients as we do  it today under our circumstances.   We  also  focus  on  latest  information,  and  new  aspects of IC/BPS transpired during this meeting.  The  final  take  home  message  of  the  ESSIC  Meeting  2017  will  be  concluded  in  an  opinion  poll under the audience.      Towards a right status of Hunner  disease/ESSIC 3C   Author: Magnus   Fall  MD PhD, Emeritus Professor Dept. of Urology  Institute of Clinical Sciences Sahlgrenska Academy  at  the University of Gothenburg  ___________________________________     In 1915 Hunner described a disease of the urinary  bladder characterized by severe urinary frequency  and  bladder  pain  and  associated  with  peculiar  cystoscopic features, findings which he called “the   elusive   ulcer”   (1).   This   disease   was   also  denominated  interstitial  cystitis  (IC)  owing  to  inflammatory   involvement   of   the   bladder  interstitium, in fact a more common designation.  Until the middle of the 20 th  century the Hunner  type of disease remained equivalent with IC, but  during the following decades IC was transformed  into a looser concept, urging a redefinition. New  criteria  were  approved  following  a  workshop  at  the  NIH  1987(2).  Still,  lack  of  uniformity  remained  and  the  diagnosis  IC  subsequently  included  patients  with  quite  a  wide  range  of  bladder related symptoms and pain (3).  In  2002  the  ICS  introduced  Overactive  Bladder  Syndrome (OAB) as a general symptom syndrome  (4) based on the symptom of urinary urgency, and  in line with this the ESSIC, in concordance with  the EAU chronic pelvic pain guidelines committee  (5), introduced Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) as a  Pain  Syndrome,  including  IC  and  presupposing  exclusion  of  confusable  diseases  (6).  The  ESSIC  definition  implies  phenotyping  according  to  cystoscopic and bladder biopsy findings.   One well- defined  phenotype  in  the  ESSIC  system  is  the  patient  with  Hunner  lesions  (HL)  at  cystoscopy  along  with  distinctive  histopathologic  findings,  type 3C. It has been noted that patients with BPS  type 3C differ from BPS patients without HL with  reference to a number of findings. The question is  therefore  raised  if  Hunner  lesion  disease  (ESSIC  type  3C)  should  be  classified  as  a  separate,  confusable disease or be kept as a BPS subtype.     Pain  patterns  indicate  differences:  Killinger and  coworkers  studied  pain  characteristics  in  subjects  with  and  without  HL  and  found  that  vaginal  penetration  was  more  painful  in  3C  patients  (7).  This   research   group   also   reported   that  fibromyalgia,  migraine,  and  temporomandibular  joint  disorders  were  more  prevalent  in  non- Hunner subjects (while 3 C patients in agreement  with previous reports had lower bladder capacities)   (8). Pain is often experienced when palpating over  the side of the bladder where lesions are located o r  when  touching  a  lesion  with  the  cystoscope,  demonstrating  the  focal  involvement  of  the  bladder wall in the 3C phenotype. Bladder volume  related pain (increasing at bladder filling, reliev ed  when voiding) is typical especially in 3C.    Cystoscopic  findings  are  typical:   Initially,  a  reddened  area  of  varying  extension  is  seen,  including  fine  vessels  radiating  towards  a  central  pale  scar  (6,  9).  At  bladder  distension  there  is  a  superficial  rupture  of  the  scar,  with  petechial  oozing  of  blood  from  small  vessels  in  the  lesion  and from mucosal margins, in a typical waterfall- like manner (9-11). Mucosal cracks are sometimes  seen especially in non-Hunner bladders but have a  much different appearance, being very superficial,  multiple,    in    non-inflamed    areas    (11).  Glomerulations  used  to  be  regarded  as  a  positive  diagnostic  proof  but  appear  to  be  nonspecific,  without importance to BPS of any type (12).     Light  microscopic  features  are  typical.   (a)  Denudation of the urothelium is a typical finding.  (b)  Granulation  tissue  is  present  in  the  vast  majority of the subjects.

The  adverse  effects  include  alopecia,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  rash  and  rarely  bleeding  tendencies.  Usually the drug is well tolerated as the incidence   of overall adverse event is almost 4%.  A trial for  at  least 3-6 months must be given before labelling a  failure to treatment. Various researchers have had  mutually  contradicting  results.  In  1997,  Sant  suggested  that  intravesical  use  of  PPS  should  be  more  efefctive  in  replenishing  the  bladder  GAG  layer.  In Europe intravesical use of PPS  has  bee n  more  popular.  Bade  et  al  reported  in  1997  their  experience  of    a 20  patients  of  IC, studied   in a  randomised placebo controlled trial.  There was a  significant  increase  in  the  bladder  capacity  and  improvement  in  nocturia,  without  a  significant  reduction in day time frequency. Daha et al (2008)  reported in an uncontrolled open label study of 29  patients , who were administered intravesical PPS  twice  a  week  over  10  weeks.  They  reported  a  significant reduction in pain  and improvement in  quality of life as per visual analog scale   (VAS).      The  newer  GAG  replenishment  like  HA,  Chondroitin Sulphate and their combinations have  been tried and will be discussed by another faculty   member during the ESSIC meeting at Budapest.                                                Side effects of instillation and how to  prevent them   Author: Sándor Lovász  MD. PhD, Urologist, Rózsakert Medical Center,  Budapest   ____________________________________________    Most side effects of instillation therapy are due t o  the  catheterization  itself.  The  mechanical damage  to the mucosal surface causes pain especially in th e  frequently  occurring  hypersensitive  cases  and  enhances the risk of infections.  We  developed  the  new  method  of  catheter-free  instillation,  which  let  us  inject  medical  solutions   (cocktails)  into  the  bladder  through  the  urethra  without causing any harm or pain to the patient.   This  technique  is  based  on  the  use  of  a  small  syringe  adapter  fitting  drop-free  into  the  external   orifice  of  the  urethra.  The  adapter  has  got  its  present   form   and   material   in   a   six-step  development  phase  within  the  last  two  and  half  years.  Based  on  the  more  than  1000  instillations  performed  in  110  patients  of  both  genders,  now  we  can  state  that  more  than  97%  of  the  patients  can  successfully be  treated  by  using  the  catheter- free instillation method.  We present the simplicity of this technique in two  short  videos  and  also  some  tips  and  tricks  of  the  drop-free instillation.  Another cause of side effects of instillation thera py  is the irritating effect of injected agents, caused  by  high  concentrated (hyperosmotic)  solutions  or by  their  low  pH  value  (acidic  solutions).  These  irritating  effects  can  be  reduced  by  diluting  the  solution with isotonic NaCl solution or by adding  buffering sodium bicarbonate solution.

Phytotherapy  is  used for urinary problems too, with great progress  in this direction.  The objective of the study was  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  romanian  „Urinary  Biomicin”  product  (UBP),  in  CPPS  subjects,  on  urinary  irritations  (UI)  and  unpleasant  urinary  feelings (UF).    Materials and methods    Subjects (n=12) were randomized divided in two  group:  a)  without  treatment  (C=6);  and  b)  with  UBP  (UB=6).  Analyzed  indicators:  UI  and  UF,  both with visual analogue scale. SCP was given for  4  weeks.  Assessments:  before  starting  treatment  (T1), after 2 weeks of treatment (T2), on the last  day  of  treatment,  (T3),  two  weeks  after  all  treatment (T4). Statistical evaluation was made on  the basis of Student test.      R esults           Interpretation of results   UI  and  UF  were  significantly  decreased  at  UB  compared to C at: T2 (UI, p=0.05; UF, p=0.03);  T3  (UI,  p=0.01;  UF,  p=0.004);  and  T4  (UI,  p=0.03; UF, p=0.01).     Conclusions    1) UBP significantly reduced UI and UF. 2) UBP  effect  was  higher  on  UF  and  after  4  weeks  of  treatment.  3)  UI  and  UF  were  significantly  decreased at UB, also 2 weeks after treatment. 4)  We suggest UBP using to improve CPPS subjects’  life, by reducing UI and UF.

The objective of the study was   to evaluate heart rate and anxiety in subjects with   chronic  pelvic  pain  syndrome  (Cpps)  versus  healthy ones, in terms of mental stress.    Materials and methods    Subjects  (n=24)  were  divided  in  group:  a)  with  Cpps (CPPS=12); and b) healthy (H=12). Mental  stress  (MS)  consisted  of  a  mathematical  exercise.  Analyzed  indicators:  heart  rate  (HR)  and  anxiety  (A). Parameters  assessments:  24h  (T1)  and 15min  (T2)  before  MS;  15min  (T3),  4h  after  MS  (T4).  Statistical  evaluation  was  made  on  the  basis  of  Student test.        Results           Interpretation of results   HR  and  A  were  significantly  decreased  at  H  compared to CPPS at: T2 (HP, p = 0.004, A, p =  0.002); T3 (HP, p = 0.01, A, p = 0.004); and T4  (HP, p = 0.04, A, p = 0.02).  Conclusions    1)  At  times  T2,  T3  and  T4,  HR  and  A  were  significantly  increased  at  CPPS.  2)  The  mental  effort  was  more  intensely  perceived  by  CPPS  compared  to  H.  3)  At  A  were  the  greatest  differences between CPPS and H. 4) We suggest  using HR and A as markers of stress assessment in  mental effort, in subjects with chronic pelvic pain   syndrome.

Materials and methods    Between 2002 – 2014 years 140 women (age 55.9  +  20.3  years)  with  BPS  type  3,  long  history  of  disease (5.4 years) and prior multiple unsuccessful   first   line   therapeutic   attempts   underwent  coagulation  HL  with  a  Ho:YAG  laser  under  general anesthesia. Results were evaluated during a   follow-up  ranging  from  3  to  12  months.  The  measures of efficacy were changes from baseline in  pain  and  urgency  (100  mm  visual  analog  scales),  changes in 24-hr frequency and functional bladder  capacity  (48-hours  voiding  log).  Evaluation  of  symptoms  severity  regarding  pain  and  voiding  problems  was  done  using  O’Leary-Sant  IC  symptom and problem index (ICSI).  Results    A pain scale improvement from a range 20-96 mm  at  baseline  to  4-30  mm  and  an  urgency  scale  improvement  from  49-92  to  3-40  mm  at  3-12  months follow up. The 24-hour voiding frequency  decreased from a baseline range 15-22 to range 6- 11  voids  per  day.  Nocturia  decreased  from  a  baseline range of 2-5.5 voids per night to range 0- 1.5  voids.  Baseline   functional  bladder  capacity   ranged  from  86+22  ml  to  195+38  ml  in  these  patients.   ICSI   index   score   correspondingly  decreased from a baseline range of 28.2+5.5 points  to 16.1+3.2 points  Interpretation of results   Analysis  of  the  data  showed  good  immediate  efficacy  of  the  method  in  134  (95.7%)  patients.  Severe  symptoms  recurred  in  period  from  4  months  to  2  years  (mean  10.1  months)  in  46  (32.9%)  patients  and  one  or  more  repeat  laser  coagulations were performed.  Conclusions    Ho:YAG  laser  coagulation  HL  is  an  effective  treatment  for  patients  with  BPS.  Approximately  30%  of  patients  require  a  repeat  procedure  and  most of these repeat procedures are done within 2  years of initial treatment.

But  they may encounter some psychological difficulties  due  to  physical  stress  (PS).  Schisandra  chinensis  (SC)  is  used for  stress modulation.  The  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  modulation  of  PS,  in  people  with CPPS, with a product containing SC (SCP).  Materials and methods    Subjects  (n=12)  were  randomized  divided  in  group:  a)  without  treatment  (C=6);  and  b)  with  SCP  (S=6).

It  is  a  common  opinion  that  IC  epidemiology  data  are  highly  inconsistent  because  of  the  lack  of  a  shared  definition and a valid diagnostic marker.   The Higher Institute of Health (ISS) was given the  task to put in place a National Registry of Rare  Diseases (NRRD) including IC/BPS. It will be  analyzed the network with some Regional  Registries, NRRD and the data performed in the  last 15 years.   Courtesy of ISS.  Materials and methods    BPS/IC epidemiology studies suffered from several  problems in the course of the past decades. Pelvic  pain  of  bladder  origin  can  be  similar  to  other  diseases  or  causes  and  the  research  methods  also  vary  influenced  by  criteria  lacking  a  universal  acceptance. This is the main reason why studies on  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of  BPS/IC  are  so  inconsistent.   The prevalence of IC/BPS varies from a minimum  of 1.8: 10,000 inhabitants up to an estimated 45- 51  cases  every  10,000  inhabitants.  These  very  significant  differences  in  terms  of  prevalence,  should  make  us  reflect  on  the  various  methods  used  to  define  an  IC  case.  Most  study  end  with  hypothetical estimates.   In  2000,  the  European  Goverment  defined  Rare  Diseases (RD) as conditions with a low prevalence  threshold  (50/100,000  inhabitants),  differently  from  the  rates  reported  by  United  States  (7.5/10,000)  and  Japan  (4/10,000).  In  May  2001  the  Ministerial  Decree  N.  279  was  approved,  Reference  Centers  for  individual  diseases  were  identified and  the NRRD was established.    The  NRRD  was  entrusted  to  the  ISS  to  collect  epidemiology data. The Reference Centers began  entering  patient  data  in  the  RR  and  yearly  to  NRRD. A data collection computerized system to  improve  the  network  performance  was  designed.   The  minimum  data  set  provides  for  mandatory  fields,  both  for  demographics  and  for  the  pathology features.     Results    We report Registry data for 2014 and 2015 in five  significant   regions   -   Lombardy,   Piedmont,  Tuscany, Marche and Lazio – as well as the overall  NRRD  data  reported  for  2013-2014.  In  2015- 2016,  NRRD data have been collected and they  are under evaluation.  Interpretation of results   In 2014, the Lombardy RR counted a prevalence  of 3.77 and in 2015 of 3.79 out of 100,000.   In 2015 the prevalence in the Piedmont RR was  of 2.63 out of 100,000.  In  2015  the  prevalence  in  the  the  Tuscany  RR  was equal to 2.43/100,000.  In 2015 the prevalence in the Marche RR was of  4, 98 out of 100,000.  In  2015  the  prevalence  in  the  Lazio  RR  was  of  5.1/100,000.   In 2013-2014 the NRRD collected 1192 patients  in a population of almost 61 million. The Italian  prevalence results 1.9 out of 100,000.   Conclusions   IC/BPS is not a common occurrence in the Italian  population.  It  is  widely  agreed  that  a  disease  registry is a valuable source of information both f or  epidemiology and for public health. Moreover, it  helps estimate the diagnostic delay, one of the key   research areas related to this type of diseases. In  the  next  years,  it  will  be  interesting  to  evaluate  the  prevalence pattern of BPS/IC in Italy, in view of a   comparison  between  Italian  data  and  other  European registries.

It  is  difficult  to  offer  this  organizational  option  due  to  the  lack  of  higher  education  centers  and  a    well-coordinated  health  network  between  Centers  of  Excellence  and  Territorial Health Services. The aim of this projec t  was  to  investigate  which  National  centers  were  able  to  offer  the  multidisciplinary  and  multi- specialistic approach to the pathology.   Mat erials and methods    According  with  AICI  (Italian  Association  of  patients  with  BPS/CI),  SIUD  (Italian  Society  of  Urodynamics)   and   FIC   (Italian   Continence  Foundation),  we  created  a  questionnaire  that  investigated the presence of specific diagnostic an d  therapeutic  services  for  BPS/IC  in  selected  National  Urologic  hospital  departments  in  Italy.  The  selected  departments  were  suggested  by  Regional  health  authorities  and  by  AICI,  SIUD  and FIC.     Results    We  sent  the  questionnaire  to  41  Urological  departments. Eleven centres met majority selection  criteria  investigated  by  the  questionnaire.  Three  Regions totally lack of a referral centre.    Interpretation of results   We  investigated  only  Urological  departments  because we consider BBS/IC a mainly urological  disease; the other specialistic fields have a suppo rt  role.

ESSIC 2017  - 25-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK   EIGHT SESSION | Free Presentations   14   both groups included  α -adrenoblocker, a drug of  the  NSAID  group  and  an  anticonvulsant  in  standard dosages recommended by the EAU.    Results   The level of total testosterone in patients of the  1st  group was 7.13 ± 0.84 ng / ml, in the 2nd group  3.11 ± 0.23 ng / ml. The NIH-CPSI index in the  1st  group  was  15.46  ±  2.28  score,  in  the  2nd  group 23.78 ± 2.90 score, the IIEF-5 index in the  1st  group  was  18.21  ±  1.43,  in  the  2nd  group  14.30 ± 2.82 score  ( р˂ 0,05) .    Interpretation of results   The sum of NIH-CPSI scores in the 2nd group is  34,99%  higher  in  comparison  with  1st  group  ( р˂ 0,05) .The  sum  of  ICEF  scores  In  the  2nd  group  is  21.47%  less  compared  to  1st  group  ( р˂ 0,05) .  Analysis  of  the  domains  of  the  NIH- CPSI  index  showed  that  the  patients  in  the  2nd  group are dominated by complaints related to the  domain  &quot;Urination&quot;  and  &quot;Quality  of  life&quot;.  The  effectiveness  of  therapy,  which  was  used  in  both  groups,  had  its  own  peculiarities.  So,  patients  of  the  2nd  group  to  reduce  /  eliminate  symptoms  needed a longer course of therapy. This was due to  the greater severity of the pain syndrome and the  need to change / select a m-cholinolytic drug (due  to  poor  compliance  associated  with  a  number  of  side effects, characteristic of m-cholinolytics).     Conclusions   Thus, in some patients, CPPS is accompanied by  secondary  hypogonadism,  which  is  probably  due  to neuroendocrine genesis. For the clinic of CP /  CPPS  of  this  group  of  patients,  pronounced  manifestations  of  the  urinary  pain  syndrome  are  characteristic.  This  phenomenon  needs  to  be  confirmed  on  large  groups  of  patients.  We  consider  it  advisable  to  continue  studying  the  effect of secondary hypogonadism on the severity  of  clinical  manifestations  of  CP  /  CPPS  and  urinary  pain  syndrome  and  the  possibilities  of  corrective therapy.

Materials and methods    110  women  diagnosed  with  BPS  between  2010  and  2014  underwent  bladder  hydrodistention.  Assessments  for  each  patient  included  a  detailed  history  and  physical  examination,  Visual  Analog  Scale  (VAS)  measures  of  pain,  O’Leary/Sant  Voiding &amp; Pain Indices (ICPI &amp; ICSI), the Pelvic  Pain  Urgency  and  Frequency  Questionnaire  (PUF),  Female  Sexual  Function  Index  (FSFI),  Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS).

There are no recommendations on the use  of  this  therapeutic  approach  in  the  treatment  of  chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The aim of the study is  to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy with   clinical  hypnosis  on  pain  symptoms  in  patients  with CPP.    Materials and methods    We evaluated 32 patients (26 females and 6 males),  average  age  36,2  years  (21-52)  with  CPP.  Initial  therapy followed conventional treatments (lifestyle   changes,  oral  therapies,  intravescical  therapies)  a s  recommended   by   guidelines   but   patients  compelled  persistence  of  pain  symptoms.  Patients  were  submitted  three  standardized  tests  (CBA,  SESAMO, MMPI-2), a questionnaire of hypnotic  suggestibility, Quality of Life Index (QLindex) and   Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) score before and after  treatment.  The  psychotherapeutic  setting  was  carried  out  for  six  months  with  weekly  sessions  and  provided  the  use  of  clinical  hypnosis  as  a  specific tool.    Results    Mean baseline VAS score was 8.15 (7-10), at the  end of the treatment 2.69 (0-8) (p&lt; 0,001). After 6   months, in 28% of cases (n=9) the VAS score was  0, in 47% between 1-4 (n=15), in 25% ≥ 5 (n=8)  (tab.1). Mean QLindex before psychotherapy was  3,31  (2-5),  afterwards  8,13  (4-10)  (p&lt;0,001).  Significant  improvement  in  performance  on  standardized  tests  for domains  including  the  level  of daily activities, sleep quality, social interact ion,  the perception of one's state of well-being.    Interpretation of results   The  psychological  distress  and  consequences  on  quality of life are a consequence of chronic pain.  In the treated population, pain is always related t o  the  experience  prior  to  the  presentation  of  symptoms.  The  discovery  of  this  cause-effect  relationship   and   subsequent   use  of   clinical  hypnosis, have determined the results presented.  Conclusions    Psychotherapeutic  treatment  with  the  use  of  clinical  hypnosis,  in  addiction  to  traditional  medical  therapies,  appears  to  be  effective  in  reducing pain.

After  clinical  suspicion,    it  is  mandatory  to  exclude  confusable  diseases  and  identify  phonotypical  aspects  of  the  disease.  There  are  different  severity  grades,  involved organs, possible allergies, and impact on  quality  of  life.  Some  of  these  aspects  can  vary  in  the  natural  history  of  disease  as  well  as  after  treatment.  To  facilitate  a  diagnostic  pathway  and  follow up, we elaborated a standardized system.    Materials and methods    We  elaborated  a  chart  with  12  items,  each  considering  a  peculiar  aspect/domain  of  the  disease:  micturing  diary,  VAS,  presence  of  pelvic/systemic   pain,   prevalence   symptom  (pain/LUTS),  validated  questionnaires,  associated  pathologies,  allergies  and  intolerances,  ESSIC  classification,  bladder  anatomical  capacity,  pelvic   floor involvement.              </p>

Other  confusable  disease  might  be  chronic  follicular  cystitis,  eosinophilic    cystitis,    tuberculous    cystitis,  metaplastic conditions and carcinoma in situ.  The  light  microscopic  features  in  diagnosing  classical  IC  should  be  denudation  of  urothelium,  signs  of  ulcerations  like  granulation  tissue,  fibri n  and neutrophils. There is a chronical inflammation  with  lymphocytes  and  plasma  cells.  The  detrusor  muscle  shows  fibrosis  separating  the  smooth  muscle bundles.  Staining of mast cells with the antibody Mast cell  Tryptase,  to  detect  mast  cells  in  the  detrusor  muscle, is important and most classical IC show a  number  of  mast  cells  above  40  per  mmW  more  often  up  to  60-100  per  mmW  using  a  grid  for  counting.  The  non-ulcerative  interstitial  cystitis  is  sharing   similar  symptomatology  and  chronic  course  but  show a different microscopic picture. The mucosa  is  almost  normal  and  the  urothelium  is  mostly  intact.  The  inflammation  might  be  sparse  but  sometimes  there  could  be  more  of  a  follicular  chronic  inflammation.  There  is  only  a  slight  fibrosis  and  the  mast  cell  count  in  the  muscle  detrusor is low.  If the pathologist gets adequate clinical informati on  and adequate deep biopsies with several fragments  of  the  detrusor  muscle  there  is  a  possibility  to  separate  the  above  conditions  with  sometimes  similar  clinical  symptoms.  If  the  pathologist  then  use  Mab  Mast  Cell  Tryptase  and  a  grid,  the  diagnose  of  classical  interstitial  cystitis  can  be  reported.

The  presence of at least one diagnostic criteria (clini cal,  endoscopic,   anatomopathologic)   justifies   the  certification of IC [1].  IC  Therapy  is  based  on  several  multidisciplinary  treatment  lines,  while  the  associated  pathologies  treated  by  the  reference  specialist.  I:  nutrition,  lifestyle,  psychotherapy  and  drugs  (painkillers,  antidepressants,  antihistamines,  anticholinergics,  mirabegron,   PEA,   alfalitics,   benzodiazepines,  paracetamol,  opioids).  II:  association  of  or  modulation.   III:   endovescical   administration  (Acyalaric  acid,  Dimethylsulfoxide).  IV:  Physical  Therapy,  Hyperbaric  Oxigenoterapy,  Intravesical  Botulinum   Toxin,   Cyclosporin   A,   Sacral  Neuromodulation.     Rehabilitation     therapy  accompanies  all  phases.  V:  demolition  surgery,  after actual failure of any other option.    Interpretation of results   A correct differential diagnosis allows to define a nd  differentiate  IC  from  PBS  and  give  a  proper  treatment.      Conclusions    PDTA is important for any specialist who may be  involved  in  the  I  and  II  Level  diagnostic  examinations.   PDTA   sharing   shortens   the  diagnosis process and makes appropriate treatment  and related monitoring available for patients.    References   1.

In  90%  of  cases  when using laboratory methods of investigation it  is not possible to detect a bacterial pathogen, the y  diagnose  chronic  non-bacterial  prostatitis  or  prostatodynia.  According  to  the  classification  of  Chronic  Prostatitis  (CP)  /  Chronic  Pelvic  Pain  Syndrome  (CPPS),  proposed  by  the  National  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Diabetes  Mellitus,  Digestive System and Kidney Disease (NIDDK), a  similar  picture  of  the  disease  corresponds  to  chronic  prostatitis  /  category  IIIA  and  IIIB.The  etiology  and  pathophysiology  of  CP  /  CPPS  remain largely unexplored. Patients with CPPS do  not manage to detect inflammatory changes; they  lack urethritis, malignant damage to the urogenital   system,  urethral  stricture  or  neurourological  damage  involving  the  bladder,  as  well  as  obvious  pathological  changes in  the  organs  of  the  urinary  system. A special role in the clinic of CPPS in men   is allocated to urinary dysfunction. To combine all   the  conditions  in  which  pain  in  the  bladder  appears,  the  terms  &quot;painful  bladder  syndrome&quot;  (PBS)  or  &quot;bladder  pain  syndrome&quot;  (BPS)  have  been proposed, which accurately reflect the disease   pattern.  Recently,  there  have  been  reports  of  an  abacterial prostatitis associated with hypogonadism .  Purpose  of  the  study  was  to  study  the  clinical  manifestations  of    CP  /  CPPS  in  men  with  a  decrease in testosterone levels.    Materials and methods   In Urology Clinic of the Odessa National Medical  University,  we  examined  24  men  with  a  non- inflammatory  form  of  CPPS,  the  average  age  of  which   was   34.53   ±   5.28   years.   Patient  examinations  included:  questionnaire  (Index  of  Symptoms  of  Chronic  Prostatitis  and  Pelvic  Pain  Syndrome  in  Men  (NIH-CPSI),  International  Index  of  Erectile  Function  (IIEF-5));  Objective  examination (including neurourological and digital  rectal examination); laboratory diagnostics (genera l  blood  and  urine  analysis,  smear  microscopy  from  the  urethra  and  secretion  of  the  prostate  gland,  bacteriological  study  of  the  secretion  of  the  prostate gland, determination of total testosterone   in  blood);  ultrasound  examination  of  the  bladder  and   scrotum   organs,   transrectal   ultrasound  examination of the prostate. All men were divided  into  2  groups:  1st  group  (21  men)  -  men  with  non-inflammatory  form  of  CPPS  of  6  or  more  months;  2nd  group  (3  men)  -  men  with  non- inflammatory  form  of  CPPS  for  a  period  of  6  months  or  more,  while  the  testosterone  level  is  decreasing.  The  criteria  for  exclusion  from  the  study were: the presence in the history of primary  hypogonadism,  cryptorchidism,  trauma  to  the  scrotum  organs.

ESSIC 2017  - 28-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK   NINTH SESSION | Focus on the patient   S  •   Ineffective  treatments  are  the  most  expensive  ones.  Instead  of  experimenting  with  different  non-invasive, but known less efficient forms of  therapy, we recommend starting with the most  effective,   casual   treatment   form,   the  intravesical  drug  instillation  therapy .  This  way we can prevent many time-consuming and  expensive treatments thus reducing progression  of the illness due to delayed efficient therapy.  •   It is often recommended to use a single GAG  component    (heparin,    hyaluronate    or  chondroitin  solution)  as  monotherapy  in  bladder  instillations.  Although  monotherapy  seems  to  be  less  expensive  than  complex  cocktails, it also proved to be less effective.  •   The  costs  of  multi-drug  instillations  can  significantly  be  reduced  by  minimizing  the  amount of the components . By using 10-20%  of  recommended  doses  the  response  rates  and  efficacy  seem  to  be  comparable.  There  is  an  urgent  need  for  setting  up  prospective  clinical  trials  to  find  optimal  (the  minimal  but  still  effective)  drug  concentrations  and  cocktail  volumes .  •   The  optimal  timing  of  instillations  (optimal  treatment   protocol)   is   not   yet   defined.  Therefore,   the   recommended   instillation  frequency   results   in   a   high   rate   of   overtreatment.   An  individually   tailored  instillation protocol  based on the continuously  monitored condition of the patient can prevent  overtreatment and minimize treatment costs.   •   Finally, the most expressed cost reduction can  be reached by introducing  self - cath eterization  and   self - treatment ,   where   the   cost   of  traveling, costs of doctor’s visit and costs of fre e  time completely fall off, and also the frequency  of  instillation  can  be  optimized  based  on  patient’s  actual  need.  Centrally  organized  teaching  courses  for  patient  education  are  inevitable to widely spread the method of self- catheterization and self-treatment.

Neurodynamic tests are manual applied techniques  for assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain  1 .  They are commonly used by manual therapists and  osteopaths  to  show  mechanosensitivity  of  the  nervous system. We investigated the prevalence of  pain areas and the mechanosensitivity of peripheral   nerves  in  a  group  patients  with  CPPS  and  compared  the  findings  with  a  healthy  control  group  3 .    Materials and methods    Healthy  volunteers  and  patients  diagnosed  with  CPPS   have   been   assessed   with   physical  examination and neurodynamic testing.    Results    The CPPS group (n = 26) and the control group  (n = 28) showed no statistical difference between  males and females for age and BMI (MW-U test).  The patients in the CPPS group were significantly  older  and  had  a  significantly  higher  weight  compared to controls. Healthy volunteers did not  show  any  pain  area  or  mechanosensitivity  of  the  examined  peripheral  nerves  of  the  lumbosacral  plexus.  Patients  with  CPPS  showed  a  variety  of  pain   from   different   musculoskeletal   origins.  Neurodynamic  testing  demonstrated  significant  mechanosensitivity  in  at  least  one  nerve  of  the  lumbosacral  plexus  in  88%  of  the  patients  with  CPPS  suggesting  minor  nerve  injuries.  Pudendal  nerve  mechanosensitivity  was  found  in  85%  of  patients,  while  42%  had  multiple nerves  attained.  Unilateral or bilateral pudendal channel palpatory  pain was present in 62% of the CPPS group and  not in controls.    Interpretation of results   The  physical  assessment,  including  neurodynamic  testing  gives  additional  information  in  patients  with CPPS.         </p>

ESSIC 2017  - 35-  ESSIC 2017   ABSTRACT BOOK   TENTH SESSION | Summary of Roundtables   unable  to  explain  the  symptoms,  are  they  diagnosed with BPS.  Grade of recommendation: C   3. Initial Treatment   •   Patient education,   •   dietary manipulation,   •   nonprescription analgesics,   •   stress reduction,   •   pelvic floor relaxation techniques comprise the  initial  treatment  of  BPS.    In  the  patient  with  findings  suggesting  pelvic  floor  dysfunction,  pelvic  floor  physical  therapy  with  myofascial  trigger  point  release  and  intravaginal  Thiele  massage  is  often  an  effective  therapeutic  intervention.   The treatment of pain  needs to  be  addressed  directly,  and  in  some  instances  referral to an anesthesia/pain center can be an  appropriate  early  step  in  conjunction  with  ongoing treatment of the syndrome.        When  conservative  therapy  fails  or  symptoms  are  severe  and  conservative  management  is  unlikely to succeed,   •   oral medication or   •   intravesical  treatment  can  be  prescribed.    It  is  recommended  to  initiate  a  single  form  of  therapy  and  observe  results,  adding  other  modalities  or  substituting  other  modalities  as  indicated  by  degree  of  response  or  lack  of  response to treatment.     Grade of   recommendation: C     4. Secondary Assessment   If  initial  oral  or  intravesical  therapy  fails ,  or  before  beginning  such  therapy  based  on  clinician  judgment,   it  is  reasonable  to  consider  further  evaluation   which  can  include  Urodynamics,  pelvic  imaging,  and  cystoscopy  with  bladder  distention  and  possible  bladder  biopsy  under  anesthesia.    •   Findings of bladder overactivity suggest a trial  of antimuscarinic therapy.    •   The  presence  of  a  Hunner  lesion  suggests  therapy    with    transurethral    resection,  fulguration  of  the  lesion,  or  direct  steroid  injection into the lesion.    •   Distention itself can have therapeutic benefit  in 30-50% of patients, though benefits rarely  persist for longer than a few months.   Grade  of recommendation: C       5 .  Refractory  BPS   Those patients with persistent, unacceptable  symptoms despite oral and/or intravesical therapy  are candidates for more aggressive modalities.   Many of these are best administered within the  context of a clinical trial if possible.  These may   include   •   neuromodulation,   •   intradetrusor botulinum toxin,    •   oral cyclosporine A, or    •   clinical trials of newly described  pharmacologic management techniques.  At  this point, most patients will benefit from the  expertise of an    •   anesthesia pain clinic.     The last step in treatment is usually some type  of surgical intervention aimed at increasing  the functional capacity of the bladder or  diverting the urinary stream.    •   Urinary diversion with or without  cystectomy has been used as a last  resort with good results in selected  patients.  Cystectomy and  urethrectomy do not appear to add any  additional efficacy to diversion alone.   (3-5)   •   Augmentation or substitution  cystoplasty seems less effective and  more prone to recurrence of chronic  pain in small reported series.     Grade of   recommendation: C                       </p>

Calcium  signaling  is  a  key  player  influencing nociception; thus our aim was to assess   whether   chronic   stress   impacts   calcium  homeostasis   and   mitochondrial   signaling   in  primary sensory neurons.  Materials and methods    Female Wistar Kyoto rats (3-4 months old) were  exposed to chronic water avoidance stress (WAS;  1hour/day for 10days). On day 11 rats were placed  in metabolism cages for 24 hours to assess bladder  function, then sacrificed. Dissociated L6-S1 dorsal   root  ganglion  (DRG)  neurons  from  control  and  WAS rats were loaded with fura-2AM (to measure  intracellular  calcium  concentration  -  [Ca 2+ ] i )  or  tetramethylrhodamine,  methyl  ester  (to  measure  mitochondria membrane potential,  Ψ m).    Results    WAS rats showed increased voiding frequency and  decreased  voided  volume.  WAS  DRG  cells  exhibited  higher  baseline  [Ca 2+ ] i  and  a  trend  towards  smaller  changes  in  [Ca 2+ ] i  in  response  to  the  mitochondria  protonophore  FCCP.  There  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  Ψ m  or  FCCP-induced  Ψ m  depolarizations.  There  were  altered  [Ca 2+ ] i   response  to  TRPA1  but  not  to  TRPV1 stimulation.    Interpretation of results   WAS  produced  changes  in  bladder  function  that  are  consistent  with  those  reported  in  IC/BPS  patients. Changes induced in the primary afferent  neurons (abnormal Ca 2+  homeostasis and buffering  mechanisms)  may  result  from  alterations  in  the  mitochondria  and/or  expression  and  function  of  ion  channels  involved  in  pain  (TRPA1).  These  can  alter  the  excitability  of  primary  afferent  neurons and contribute to urgency, frequency and  pain.    Conclusions    Our    findings    demonstrate    that    chronic  psychological   stress   induces   altered   Ca 2+   homeostasis  in  primary  afferent  neurons.  These  persistent changes can influence the production of  stress  and  pain  mediators,  which  can  underlay  altered sensation and painful symptoms in patients  with IC/BPS.      11.

Dyspareunia  presents in many ways, and arises from a range of  causes. Chronic Pelvic Pain is one potential cause  that  may  frequently  be  overlooked  by  clinicians.   CPP  is  increasingly recognized  as more  common  than  was  once  thought.  However,  it  can  be  difficult  to  identify,  as  the  symptoms  of  CPP  overlap  with  other  conditions.    The  presentation  will include the following topics:   Chronic Pelvic Pain   CPP  Syndromes -  Lower  Urinary  Tract  Pain,  Male   Genital   Pain,   Female   Genital   Pain,  Gastrointestinal   Pain,   Musculoskeletal   Pain,  Neuropathic  Pain,  Psychological  overlay,  Sexual  Pain, Extra-Pelvic Co-Morbidities  Psychological -   Findings   support   growing  evidence that the negative affective, cognitive and   psychosocial  state  of  chronic  pain  is  universal,  regardless of a neuropathic or nociceptive nature.

How to reduce costs of IC treatment   Author: Sándor Lovász  MD. PhD, Urologist, Rózsakert Medical Center,  Budapest   _________________________________________  There  is  sporadic  information  on  costs  of  IC  treatment,  which  can  significantly  vary  between  different countries depending on used medications  and different treatment protocols.  Long lasting local instillations and the maintenanc e  therapy  are  a  great  expense  to  the  patients  preventing  a  significant  portion  of  them  from  getting be treated.   There are many components of the treatment cost:  •   Delay  of the proper diagnosis  of  IC   causes  a  huge  amount  of  expenses  due  to  series  of  inadequate  therapy  (misdiagnosis),  sometimes  for many years  •   The  widely  accepted  first  choice  of  therapy:  noninvasive but less efficient treatment forms  •   Monotherapy  at  bladder  instillations  –  limited  efficacy   •   Complex   bladder   “cocktails”   -   multiple  components  •   Overdosed  drugs  at  instillations  -  expensive  medications  •   Unified instillation protocols (overtreatment)  •   Costs of traveling to the doctor  •   Costs of medical assistance  •   Costs of free time (day off, holiday)    How to reduce expenses:  •   Reduce  time  till  proper  diagnosis   by  both  patient  educations  and  organized  education  courses for urologists, gynecologists, and GP-s.   Journals,  radio,  television  and  social  media  should  also  be  involved  to  provide  regular  information on IC/BPS.  </p>

Interpretation of results   Although    any    pathological    feature    is  pathognomonic  of  IC,  bladder  biopsy  is  strongly  recommended to identify or rule-out IC.    Conclusions    Whole   specimen   analysis   combined   with  immunoistochemical  staining  (CD117)  gives  an  objective  evaluation  of  the  inflammatory  disease  and  tissue  damage  of  the  bladder.  Pathological  criteria  combined  with  clinical  and  endoscopic  help clinician to identify IC from painful bladder  syndrome.

The  diagnosis  is  too  late,  as well  as   the  discovery  of  several  associated  systemic  pathologies  because  the  diagnostic  criteria  are  indefinite. The definitive diagnosis is only assign ed  to Reference Centers distributed nationwide. The  purpose of the PDTA is to highlight the minimum  diagnostic  criteria  and  promote  their  diffusion  in  order  to  shorten  the  diagnostic  route  and  adopt  appropriate therapies.

ESSIC 2017  - 2-  ESSIC 2017 ABSTRACT BOOK  FIRST SESSION | Basic knowledge about GAG’s, mast c ells, urothelium and pain  on distinct effector cells to produce the symptoms  of allergy and anaphylaxis. The broad spectrum of  functions  of  mast  cells  might  explain  why  mast  cells  can  be  involved  in  so  many  different  pathologies  beyond  allergy.  An  increase  in  mast  cells  with  in  tissues  is  observed  in  many  pathological   conditions   including,   asthma,  atherosclerosis,   autoimmune   diseases,   atopic  dermatitis,  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  BPS,  multiple  sclerosis,  psoriasis,  rheumatoid  arthritis ,  sarcoidosis, tumor growths and BPS (Theoharides  and  Cochrane,  2004;Theoharides  and  Conti,  2004). Apart from being prominently involved in  immune and inflammatory responses, mast cells are  critical  for  the  tissue  integrity  and  function.  Thi s  correlates with their presence in nearly all tissue s.  The   role   of   mast   cells   in   Bladder   Pain  Syndrome(BPS)  and  Interstitial  Cystitis(IC)  has  been  heavily  looked  into  but  has  never  been  proven.  In 1982 (7) it was suggested, that mast cell count  in the detrusor muscle of ≥28 per mm 2  might be  diagnostic  for  IC  and  in  practice  became  that  in  Denmark for 20 years.

Women  with  lower  urinary BC were significantly more likely to report   depression (mean HADS 17.09)    Interpretation of results   Low  bladder  capacity  under  anesthesia  was  significantly  associated  with  high  symptom  scores  on  three  validated  BPS  questionnaires  as  well  as  with urinary frequency. These results suggest that  low  bladder  capacity  is  a  marker  for  a  bladder- centric manifestation of BPS.    Conclusions    Inflammation,  collagen  deposition  and  alterations  in  the  extracellular  matrix  (ECM)  leading  to  chronic  fibrosis  that  ultimately  results  in  a  reduction in BC. Identification of these sub-group  BPS  patients  early  in  the  disease  treatment  may  provide   an   opportunity   for   more   directed  therapeutic  intervention  and  add  in  complex  therapy  of  anti-fibrotic  agents  to  increase  wall  compliance  and  enhance  contractile  function  of  bladders.

Comparison of efficacy intravesical, oral  and combined GAG - replenishment therapy  as  Painful  Bladder  Syndrome  treatment  modality   Authors:  Yakov Mirkin  (1)   Uro-pro     Clinics&amp;hospitals,     Urogynecology     And  Neurourology, Krasnodar, Russian Federation  (1)  _______________________________________________  Introduction and aim of the study    Painful   Bladder   Syndrome   (PBS)   is   severe  condition with high impact on quality of life. One  of the main hypothesis of pathogenesis PBS is the  urothelium  damage  due  to  GAG-layer  failure.  According    this    hypothesis,    the    GAG- replenishment  therapy  is  widely  used  with  intravesical and rarely, oral administration. We’ve   decided  to  compare  efficacy  of  intravesical,  oral  and combined therapy.     Materials and methods    39 female patients participated in study. Inclusion   criteria were pain at the pubic area during bladder   filling, frequent urination, nocturia in the absenc e  of obvious bladder pathology. All participants fill ed  voiding  diary,  O’Leary-Sant  questionnaire  (IC  Symptoms   Index/IC   Problem   Index),   PBS  Analogue Scale. After that, participants have been  randomized  into three  groups:  1 st   group received  12  instillations  of  sodium  hyaluronate,  one  procedure  per  week,  2 nd   group  received  oral  therapy  (chondroitin  sulfate,  glucosamine)  –  3  capsules daily - 3 months, 3 rd  group received both  types of therapy.    Results      Before   After     1 st   group   2 nd   group   3 rd   group   Voiding  Diary   26,8 + 5 ,7   16,3 + 3,9   18,5 + 4,2   12,6 + 3,1   O’Leary /  IC  Symptoms  Index   13,2 + 3 ,3   10,1 + 2,4   11,4 + 2,8   8,8 + 1,3   O’Leary /  IC  Problems  Index   10,6 + 2 ,2   8,3 + 1,6   9,1 + 1,8   6,3 + 1,0   PBS  Analogue  Scale   25,3+7 ,6   16,3 + 4,4   20,1 + 5,2   12,8 + 3,8     Interpretation of results   Combined  GAG-replenishment  therapy  is  more  effective than separate intravesical and oral thera py.  Combined  GAG-replenishment  therapy  could  be  recommended  as  PBS  treatment  option,  but  further trials are needed.   </p>
