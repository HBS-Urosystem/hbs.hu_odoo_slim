Prolonged exposure of the diseased tissue to the drug is of crucial  importance. Drug-delivery systems (DDSs) have been introduced to control rate, time, and place  of release. Drugs can easily reach the bladder through a catheter, while systemically administered  agents may undergo extensive metabolism. Continuous urine filling and subsequent washout  hinder intravesical drug delivery (IDD). Moreover, the low permeability of the urothelium, also  described as the bladder permeability barrier, poses a major challenge in the development of the  IDD. DDSs increase bioavailability of drugs, therefore improving therapeutic effect and patient  compliance. This review focuses on novel DDSs to treat bladder conditions such as overactive  bladder, interstitial cystitis, bladder cancer, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The rationale  and strategies for both systemic and local delivery methods are discussed, with emphasis on new  formulations of well-known drugs (oxybutynin), nanocarriers, polymeric hydrogels, intravesi - cal devices, encapsulated DDSs, and gene therapy. We give an overview of current and future  prospects of DDSs for bladder disorders, including nanotechnology and gene therapy. Keywords:  drug targeting, drug-delivery system, bladder disorders Introduction Drug targeting is the ability of a drug to accumulate in a specific organ or tissue selec - tively and quantitatively, independently of the site and methods of its administration. 1   This concept has been suggested by Paul Ehrlich a century ago. He spread the idea of  the “magic bullet” for the synthesis of antibacterials. This was represented by the ars - phenamine, the first truly effective drug against syphilis, and marketed under the name  Salvarsan (“the arsenic that saves”) at the beginning of the 1910s. Targeted treatment  has obvious advantages. Pharmaceutical therapies are often dosed systemically, while  their targets may be a specific tissue or a single compartment of the body. Therefore,  the drug is distributed within the body and also has to cross biological barriers. Large  quantities of drugs have to be administered to achieve a therapeutic concentration in  a certain body compartment, also increasing the chances of negative side effects. It is  understandable as to how research on drug targeting is under constant development and  different delivery systems have been devised. The rationale is to improve efficacy by  increasing the concentration at a target site while simultaneously minimizing toxicity  by reducing off-target accumulation. 2 An economic issue should also be addressed. In fact, the introduction of a new drug  molecule in the market is expensive and time consuming, as it involves discovery, clini - cal testing, development, and regulatory approval.

This can be obtained  by controlling the rate, time, and place of release of drugs  in the body through a drug-delivery system (DDS). Hence,  DDS is an interface between the patient and the drug. It may  be a formulation of the drug to administer it for a therapeutic  purpose or a device used to deliver the drug. 3 Selective pharmacologic targeting to individual compart - ments of the body is challenging. A therapeutic agent may  be known, but its clinical application could be hindered by  difficulties  in  achieving  targeted  delivery.  Certain  physi - ologic compartments such as the bladder, brain, and eye are  viewed as “privileged” and may require specific techniques  or devices to physically target drugs at the site of disease. 4 Traditionally, many genitourinary conditions have been  treated  with  medications  administered  orally.  To  increase  efficacy and patient compliance, alternative delivery systems  have  been  devised. The  bladder  is  easily  accessible  using  a  catheter  or  cystoscope  through  the  urethra  by  a  simple  procedure that can be performed by health care practitioners  or  even  by  patients  themselves  (clean  intermittent  self- catheterization). This review focuses on novel DDS for bladder disorders  such as overactive bladder (OAB), interstitial cystitis (IC),  bladder cancer (BC), and recurrent urinary tract infections  (UTIs). Functional anatomy of urinary  bladder The bladder is a hollow elastic organ that accommodates and  stores urine, and facilitates voiding at appropriate intervals.  Its size varies during filling, and normal capacity is  ∼ 500   mL.  Inner aspect of the bladder is lined by the urothelium, which  is  crucial  in  order  to  design  effective  intravesical  drug  delivery (IDD). It is a stratified epithelium, also known as  transitional  epithelium,  with  a  layer  of  unique  “umbrella  cells” forming the luminal surface. 5  These cells can flatten  and increase surface area with stretching. 6  Umbrella cells are  covered by rigid plaques, composed of four major uroplakins,  UPIa (27   kDa), UPIb (28   kDa), UPII (15   kDa), and UPIII  (47   kDa). 7  The impermeability of the urothelium is further  augmented by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which form a  mucin hydrophilic layer adherent to the luminal side. 8  These  GAGs form a very tight barrier, capable of facing potentially  noxious levels of urea, ammonia, and other toxic metabolites  for prolonged periods of time. The function of this barrier is  similar to the blood–brain barrier, with the only difference  that  the  bladder  is  a  storage  organ,  and  needs  to  be  more  resistant to the passage of molecules. This is also known as  the  bladder  permeability  barrier  (BPB)  and  represents  an  important obstacle in the success of IDD ( Figure  1). 9 DDSs in bladder disease Novel  DDSs  have  been  devised  to  treat  major  bladder  disorders.  These  are  briefly  summarized  in  the  following  paragraphs. Overactive bladder OAB is a symptom syndrome which is defined by the pres - ence of urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usu - ally accompanied by frequency and nocturia in the absence  Serosa Bladder Urine Urethra Sphincter Adventitia Basal cells Lumen Umbrella cells Intermediate cells Detrusor Muscularis mucosae Lamina propria Urothelium GAG layer Basal membrane Fig ure 1  Structure of the urinary bladder wall and urothelium.

Main presenting  symptoms are frequency, urgency, nocturia, and bladder pain,  which often increases as the bladder fills and reduces after  micturition. 14  The pathophysiology is poorly understood and  considered  multifactorial.  Currently,  the  most  accep table   theory is injury or dysfunction of the GAG layer. 15  Current  treatment involves dietary manipulation, pain management,  bladder  retraining,  and  medication. There  are  several  oral  or  intravesical  options  with  variable  efficacy,  and  to  date,  there  is  no  consensus  regarding  which  treatment  is  best.  Potentially,  IDD  could  better  restore  the  integrity  of  the  urothelial membrane. 16 Bladder cancer BC is caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells that line the  bladder wall. It is the seventh most common cancer in the UK  and the ninth worldwide. 17,18  Main risk factors are increasing  age,  smoking,  and  exposure  to  urothelial  carcinogens. 19,20   Transitional cell carcinomas account for  . 90% of tumors,  while  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  adenocarcinoma  rep - resent  ∼ 5%  and  1%,  respectively.  Symptoms  may  include  hematuria,  frequency,  urgency,  and  dysuria.  Seventy-five  percent to 80% of BCs present as non-muscle-invasive dis - ease, which can be managed with intravesical therapy. In these  cases,  either  a  chemotherapeutic  drug  or  immunotherapy  with Bacillus Calmette–Guérin may be given transurethrally.  Novel DDSs could increase the stay of the drug in the blad - der and potentially improve efficacy and therefore survival  rate of the disease. Recurrent urinary tract infections UTI  is  one  of  the  most  common  infectious  diseases  worldwide. Ten  percent  to  15%  of  all  women  will  experi - ence  recurrent  UTIs. 21  These  are  defined  as  three  or  more  episodes of UTI during a 12-month period or two infections  in a 6-month period. 22 Escherichia coli , the species most commonly involved in  UTIs, can invade the urothelium and establish reservoirs in  the cytoplasm of apical cells. 23  Systemic antibiotics may not  achieve effective doses in the bladder and also fail to penetrate  the urothelium to eradicate intracellular reservoirs. Moreover,  in the long-term, they can lead to antimicrobial resistances,  side effects, and low patient compliance. Novel DDSs could  allow higher concentrations of antibiotics in the bladder in  order to pass through the urothelial cell membranes. Targeted bladder DDSs A DDS is a formulation or a device that enables the introduc - tion of a therapeutic substance in the body and improves its  efficacy and safety by controlling the rate, time, and place  of release of drugs in the body. It involves the administra - tion  of  the  therapeutic  product,  the  release  of  the  active  ingredients  by  the  product,  and  the  subsequent  transport  of the active ingredients across the biological membranes  to the site of action. A significant amount of work in drug  delivery targeted to the bladder has focused on the disorders  mentioned above. Drugs may be either administered directly  to  the  bladder,  or  given  systemically  and  targeted  to  the  bladder. Most of the drugs available for treatment of blad - der  diseases  are  administered  orally. The  reasons  for  this  preference  are  the  ease  of  administration  and  widespread  acceptance  by  patients. The  challenge  consists  in  deliver - ing an effective dose in the bladder minimizing undesired  biodistribution which could increase side effects. Different  strategies  have  been  developed  to  find  drugs  with  bet - ter  efficacy  and  tolerability,  leading  to  novel  therapeutic  options. The bladder can be easily accessed using a catheter  or cystoscope through the urethra. Hence, it is an attractive  local drug-delivery target.

Research and Reports in Urology 2015:7 submit your manuscript  |  www.dovepress.co m Dove press  Dove press 175 Novel targeted bladder drug-delivery systems TARIS Biomedical carried out a Phase I safety assess - ment  study  in  healthy  volunteers. An  empty  device  was  inserted  into  the  bladder  of  seven  women,  while  three  women  underwent  cystoscopy  without  placement  of  the  device. Tolerability was assessed using visual analog scales  for bladder sensation and voiding behavior, which revealed  that  changes  from  baseline  were  similar  between  groups.  A  Phase  Ib  cohort  study  in  16  women  with  moderate-to- severe IC followed. Subjects received either LiRIS ®  200   mg  or  LiRIS ®   650   mg  for  2   weeks. There  was  a  significant  improvement in bladder pain, urinary urgency, and voiding  frequency.  Cystoscopic  findings  also  improved  on  day  14  (day of removal) compared with day 1. Most strikingly, of  the six patients who were noted to have Hunner’s lesion on  cystoscopic insertion, five demonstrated complete resolution  14   days later. Global response assessment showed an overall  responder  rate  of  64%  at  day  14  and  a  sustained  overall  responder  rate  of  64%  2   weeks  later.  Extended  follow-up  suggests that the reduction in pain was maintained for several  months after the device was removed. Expanded Phase II/ III  trials  are  now  underway.  Potentially,  other  therapeutic  agents could be delivered by the device for the treatment of  other bladder disorders. 64 Allergan  Inc.  is  sponsoring  two  Phase  II  clinical  trials  that aim to establish the safety and efficacy of LiRIS ®  in IC  patients with 65  and without 66  Hunner’s lesions. e ncapsulated DDS There  are  pilot  data  showing  the  feasibility  of  loading  an  antibiotic  into  a  non-cell-toxic  microcapsule  that  can  both  penetrate  bladder  cells  and  provide  slow  release  of  the  drug  that  retains  its  bactericidal  properties. 67   This  system has been developed for the delivery of high doses  of antibiotic to treat recalcitrant UTIs. The capsules have  been prepared with coaxial electrohydrodynamic forming  technology,  which  has  shown  considerable  promise  for  the  production  of  fibers  and  particles  at  the  micro-  and  nanoscale. 68   Polymethylsilsesquioxane  has  showed  good  biocompatibility and physiological inertness and has been  inserted in the capsules together with gentamicin. 69  In an  in vitro assay, the capsules were able to kill  Enterococcus  faecalis , the most common uropathogen. Moreover, the cap - sules were incubated with bladder epithelial cells collected  from the urine of patients with UTIs. Successful delivery  in  bladder  cells  was  demonstrated,  but  the  mechanism  is  still unknown. High localized doses of antibiotic could be  reached by introducing the capsules directly into the blad - der via a catheter. Gene therapy Gene therapy is a promising therapy for controlling BC as  it  is  highly  selective  for  tumor  cells  with  mutated  genes.  Moreover,  it  carries  the  potential  of  restoring  normal  cell  growth  by  correcting  genetic  defects.  Gene  delivery  systems  include  both  viral  (adenovirus)  and  nonviral  vec - tors (lipoplexes). In  viral  vectors,  the  genome  contains  the  therapeutic  gene  that  is  carried  into  the  mutated  cells.  Viral  receptor  expression  and  urothelium  represent  barriers  that  research  is  trying  to  overcome.  Viral  vectors  are  associated  with  permeation enhancers to improve the delivery of intravesical  gene therapy. Modulation of coxsackie-adenovirus receptor  expression 70   and  coadministration  of  polyamide  Syn  3  are  active research fields. 71  Although the use of Syn 3 appears  to  be  nontoxic  to  the  bladder  tissue,  other  transduction- enhancing  agents  may  produce  adverse  effects  on  the  urothelium. 72,73 Nonviral  vectors  consist  of  genes  incorporated  into  liposomes, such as IL-12 gene, to induce immune response.  The  interest  toward  these  vectors  has  increased  due  to  the  potential of toxicity from systemic absorption of viral vectors  from the bladder. 74 Small “interfering” RNAs delivered into the bladder using  liposomes have been effective in vivo and may represent a  novel therapeutic tool. 75  Gene therapy has also been devel - oped to treat OAB and IC in rat models and may represent  a future treatment modality. 76  From epidemiologic studies,  there is increasing evidence that bladder disorders as UI and  OAB are heri table  conditions. Underlying genetic variants  have been identified and could potentially represent future  drug targets. 77 Conclusion The  goal  of  targeted  delivery  drugs  is  to  transport  proper  amounts  of  drugs  to  the  desirable  sites  while  minimizing  unwanted  side  effects  on  other  tissues.  Several  strategies  have  been  developed  within  the  last  decade. Various  drug  formulations, routes of drug administration, as well as devices  for drug delivery and targets have been described. The blad - der  is  an  ideal  target  for  local  drug  delivery  as  it  is  easily  accessed through the urethra. IDD is however hindered by  continuous filling of the bladder with urine, the low perme - ability of the BPB, and the washout during voiding. Hence,  serial drug instillations are often required. In the last decade, novel DDSs have been devised with  the aim to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce costs  linked to the discovery of new drugs.

TCGel ®   is  slowly excreted from the bladder during urination. It is 100%  biocompatible and harmless to the body. TheraCoat Ltd has  commenced several efficacy clinical trials. A Phase I/II clinical trial was completed in Israel explor - ing  the  feasibility,  tolerability,  and  safety  of  200  units  of  onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox ® ) premixed with chilled 40   mL  of TCGel ® . Fifteen patients with IC were enrolled in the trial  and received a single instillation. Follow-up was at weeks 2,  6, and 12 post-instillation. The efficacy outcome measures  included IC Symptom Index (ICSI) and IC Problem Index  (ICPI).  A  reduction  in  the  ICSI  and  ICPI  was  observed  since week 2 and was also apparent at week 12. Likewise, a  reduction from baseline was observed in the daytime urinary  frequency and urge episodes, while the nocturnal frequency  remained unchanged. No serious drug-related adverse events  were reported. 55 TheraCoat Ltd also completed the Intravesical Botulinum  Toxin Treatment for OAB (INTIMO) study, a double-blind  placebo-controlled  study  aiming  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of bladder instillation with botulinum toxin and TCGel ®  in  patients with OAB, but the results are not as yet available. 56 Other ongoing clinical trials are currently looking at the  intravesical instillation of mitomycin C (MMC) mixed with  TCGel ®   in  patients  with  non-muscle-invasive  BC  (Opti - mized Instillation of Mitomycin for bladder cancer treatment  [OPTIMA]  study). 57   Preclinical  results  demonstrated  the  following: – 	 levels of MMC in the bladder 2   hours and 6   hours fol - lowing instillation were over tenfold higher as compared  to drug alone (same total dosage); – 	 levels of MMC in the urine were higher for a longer period  of time compared to drug alone; – 	 levels of MMC in the plasma were low, confirming safety  of the treatment. For intravesical chemotherapy, hydrophobic anticancer  drugs  offer  a  distinct  advantage  of  greater  permeability  through the urothelium as compared to hydrophilic drugs.  This  allows  longer  retention  of  therapeutic  doses  within  the bladder tissue even after the instilled solution is washed  out after voiding. Loading hydrophobic drugs into carriers  for  sustained  IDD  is  viewed  as  one  of  the  most  promis - ing  strategies  to  ensure  continuous  presence  of  drug  in  the bladder with fewer or no intermittent catheterization.  Mucoadhesive  nanogels  have  been  recently  evaluated  in  porcine urinary bladder and could be a promising candi - date for intravesical delivery of hydrophobic drugs in BC  therapy. 58 i ntravesical devices Intravesical  instillation  therapy  has  a  number  of  potential  benefits  including  high  drug  concentration  at  the  bladder  and reduced systemic exposure which minimizes systemic  toxicity  and  side  effects  compared  to  oral  medications.  However, repeated instillations are often required to extend  the drug exposure, and this lowers the compliance. Indwelling  intravesical devices are physical devices that can be inserted  and  remain  in  the  bladder. The  drug  is  then  released  from  the device in a controlled and extended manner. The device  can be either biodegradable or nondegradable. The former  eliminates the device removal step but can provoke debris  that might lead to voiding difficulties. A reservoir-based device constructed of a completely bio - degradable elastomer supplying ciprofloxacin-HCl has been  evaluated in vitro and showed functionality and stability. 59   Biodegradable  devices  have  also  been  studied  for  IDD  of  antimuscarinics  as  this  could  represent  an  alternative  to  oral treatment for OAB. In vitro studies in a porcine bladder  model showed effectiveness of trospium chloride (TrCl) when  loaded  onto  degradable  poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-based  polymer  carriers. 60   Lipid-based  intravesical  DDSs  were  loaded with TrCl and showed a drug release ranging from  several days up to weeks. 61 Trials with nondegradable indwelling devices first evalu - ated an intravesical pump called UROS, developed by Situs  Corporation Ltd (Houston TX, USA). The device was tested  in  Phase  I/II  trials. 62   However,  no  more  recent  trials  have  been published. A nonbiodegradable device, Lidocaine Releasing Intra - vesical  System  (LiRIS ® ;  TARIS  Biomedical,  Lexington,  MA,  USA),  has  been  deemed  for  intravesical  delivery  of  lidocaine.  It  has  a  double  design:  one  tube  contains  solid  lidocaine hydrochloride mini table ts, enabling a higher dose  of  drug  than  if  a  solution  was  used,  and  the  other  lumen  contains  nickel  titanium  wire,  which  adopts  a  “pretzel”  conformation  once  inside  the  bladder,  preventing  it  from  being accidentally voided. It is retained in the bladder with  minimal  discomfort,  allowing  release  of  lidocaine  for  a  sustained period. A silicone container absorbs urine to dis - solve the lidocaine contents, whereas the osmotic pressure  created  forces  the  solution  out  of  the  container  through  a  small orifice in a controlled release over 14   days. Promising  results were achieved when the device was tried in a rabbit  model. In fact, lidocaine concentration in the bladder tissue  was  . 0.1   μ g/g  during  the  3-day  period  of  device  release,  while  a  single  instillation  yielded  immeasurable  amounts  within 24   hours. 63 </p>

Research and Reports in Urology 2015:7 submit your manuscript  |  www.dovepress.co m Dove press  Dove press 173 Novel targeted bladder drug-delivery systems The intravesical administration of hyaluronic acid (HA)  has been shown to be effective in the IC, as it replaces GAG  layer. 36   Moreover,  it  inhibits  leukocyte  aggregation  and  migration,  and  adherence  of  immune  complexes  to  poly - morphonuclear cells. 37  Recent studies demonstrated how HA  significantly  suppresses  the  secretion  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and also increases the  levels of sulfated GAGs. 38 However, DDSs are also associated with some difficulties.  Firstly,  drug  dilution  occurs  as  the  urine  is  continuously  produced  and  due  to  subsequent  washout  during  urine  voiding. Secondly, the urothelium forms a low permeability  barrier, allowing poor penetration of drugs into the bladder  wall. Thirdly, repetitive catheterization may reduce patient  compliance. To overcome this matter, different strategies have  been employed. Drugs may be injected into the bladder wall.  For example, in cases of OAB refractory to antimuscarinics,  intradetrusorial injection of onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox ® ;  Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) is currently routine practice  in  most  of  the  units  dealing  with  lower  urinary  tract  dys - functions. 39  Other approaches to increase drug permeability  are  physical  methods  and  chemical  permeation  enhancers  ( Table  2). Novel targeted DDSs have recently been developed to  prolong  the  effect  of  drugs  in  the  bladder. This  has  been  possible  with  the  introduction  of  nanotechnology  in  the  field of drug delivery. This science refers to structures that  have  one  or  more  dimensions  in  the  nanometer  scale. 41   Substances  are  loaded  within  nanoparticles. 42  This  holds  a high potential of improving the therapeutic value of dif - ferent  drugs  by  increasing  bioavailability,  solubility,  and  retention time. 43 Nanocarriers Nanocarriers can deliver drugs to site-specific targets. They  can be formulated from materials such as lipids, polymers,  proteins, and metals. 44 Liposomes  are  phospholipid  concentric  bilayer  nano - spheres mimicking human cell walls. They allow the delivery  of both lipophilic drugs such as capsaicin and hydrophilic  drugs such as botulinum toxin. Clathrin-mediated endocyto - sis is their route of entry into the urothelium. 45 Intravesical  administration  of  liposomes  alone  can  enhance resistance to irritant penetration as shown in a rat  model  with  hyperactive  bladder. 46   Further  studies  showed  that  intravesical  liposomes  are  safe  and  have  similar  effi - cacy  to  one  of  the  most  effective  FDA-approved  pharma - cological  treatments  for  IC  as  oral  pentosan  polysulfate  (PP)  (Elmiron ® ).  Empty  liposomes  have  been  shown  to  be effective as potential treatment of IC. 47  This is thought to  be related to their ability to form a protective lipid film on the  urothelial surface. In a pilot study, intravesical instillation of  PP encapsulated in liposomes was effective in refractory IC  patients. 48  However, studies with bigger number and placebo  groups are warranted. Liposomal  vesicles  enhance  the  therapeutic  index  of  chemotherapeutic  agents  and  represent  a  promising  approach for cancer treatment. 49  Currently, a Phase II trial is  evaluating temperature-sensitive liposomes plus local hyper - thermia in patients with recurrent chest wall breast cancer. 50   Encouraging results could lead to explore this approach in  different clinical setting, including BC. Other  nanocarriers  that  can  be  used  for  IDD  are  solid  lipid  nanoparticles,  protein  nanoparticles  with  targeted  ligands  grafted  on  the  surface,  branched  polymeric  den - drimers, mucoadhesive biopolymers (chitosan) or synthetic  polymers,  magnetic  particles,  gold  nanoshells,  and  in  situ  gelling systems. 51 Polymeric hydrogels A novel approach is the use of hydrogels as depot formula - tions on the bladder walls. This enables longer exposure of  the urinary tract tissue to existing drugs, as compared to stan - dard intravesical instillation, as they remain attached to the  bladder wall even after urine voiding. 52  Between the different  types that have been developed, thermosensitive hydrogels  have gained increasing attention. 53  These are aqueous solu - tions of poly (ethylene glycol-b-[ dl -lactic acid-co-glycolic  acid]-b-ethyleneglycol) triblock copolymers that form a free- flowing solution at room temperature and become a viscous  gel at body temperature of 37 ° C. 54 There  are  several  potential  polymeric  gel  systems  that  have been explored. TCGel ®  is a novel hydrogel with reverse  thermal  gelation  properties  produced  by  TheraCoat  Ltd  (Raanana, Israel). This means that it is fluid when cold and a  gel at body temperature. Following instillation, the gel solidi - fies and acts as sustained drug release depot in situ. When  the  gel  is  in  contact  with  urine,  it  dissolves  and  gradually  Table  2  Strategies for improving drug permeability Physical approaches     e lectromotive drug administration   Hyperthermia (intravesical mitomycin C instillation) 40 Chemical approaches   Dimethyl sulfoxide   Protamine sulfate   Biomolecules (chitosan, polycarbophil) </p>

Research and Reports in Urology 2015:7 submit your manuscript  |  www.dovepress.co m Dove press  Dove press 172 Zacchè et   al New  formulations  of  well-known  drugs  are  in  constant  development in order to minimize side effects and improve  tolerability.  For  example,  oxybutynin  is  the  most  widely  prescribed antimuscarinic for OAB. 24  Oxybutynin is a tertiary  amine,  and  when  administered  orally,  undergoes  extensive  upper  gastrointestinal  and  first-pass  hepatic  metabolism  via  the  cytochrome  P450  system.  Its  primary  metabolite  is  N -desethyloxybutynin  ( N -DEO)  and  is  the  major  con - tributor to the occurrence of dry mouth. 25  Extended-release  formulations  when  compared  to  immediate-release  cause  less  reduction  in  saliva  production,  a  typical  side  effect  of  antimuscarinics. 26 Transdermal route As an alternative to oral route, transdermal drug delivery of  oxybutynin has been introduced, and the US Food and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approved  it  in  2003.  Not  surpris - ingly, reducing first-pass metabolism, the transdermal route  has shown better tolerability. 27,28  Transdermal patches were  the first to be marketed, followed by transdermal gel, with  the aim of reducing application site reactions as erythema  and pruritus. 29  Penetration enhancers have also been used to  facilitate transdermal drug transport. Recently, Goldfischer  et   al published the results of a Phase III trial that looked at  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  oxybutynin  transdermal  gel  3%  (OTG3%) formulated with propylene glycol as permeation  enhancer. OTG3% 84   mg and OTG3% 56   mg were compared  with placebo gel in adults with urgency and/or mixed urinary  incontinence  (UI).  In  December  2011,  the  FDA  approved  the  availability  of  OTG3%  (84   mg/d)  in  a  titra table   pump  dispenser, while the lower dose (56   mg/d) was not approved.  Six hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized 1:1:1  in  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study.  The  primary  efficacy  end  point  was  change  from  base - line  to  week  12  in  weekly  UI  episodes  recorded  in  3-day  bladder  diaries.  Secondary  end  points  were  change  from  baseline to week 12 in daily urinary frequency and change  from baseline to week 12 in average urinary void volume.  OTG3%  84   mg/d  achieved  significantly  greater  improve - ment vs placebo in weekly UI episodes (mean change from  baseline: –20.4 vs –18.1,  P , 0.05), daily urinary frequency  (–2.6 vs –1.9,  P = 0.001), and urinary void volume (32.7 vs  9.8,  P , 0.0001). Dry mouth and application site erythema  were  more  common  with  OTG3%  84   mg/d  than  with  pla - cebo (12.1% vs 5.0%,  P = 0.028, and 3.7% vs 1.0%,  P = NS,  respectively). Changes from baseline to week 12 of OTG3%  56   mg/d  vs  placebo  were  not  significant  for  primary  and  secondary outcomes. 30 v aginal route The  vaginal  route  represents  an  alternative  for  women  who  are unable to tolerate adverse effects of oral antimuscarinics  or application site reactions associated with topical/transder - mal products. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd introduced  a  flexible  transvaginal  ring  that  is  designed  to  continuously  release  oxybutynin  (DR-3001).  In  view  of  the  promising  results of a Phase II trial, 31  DR-3001 underwent a Phase III  evaluation. One thousand one hundred and two women with  pure-predominantly  urge  UI  were  randomized  to  DR-3001  4   mg/d,  DR-3001  6   mg/d,  or  placebo  vaginal  ring,  inserted  vaginally  and  replaced  every  4   weeks.  In  this  multicenter,  12-week trial, the primary end point was the change in total  weekly  number  of  UI  episodes.  Secondary  outcomes  were  change  in  average  daily  urinary  frequency,  void  volume,  and proportion of subjects with no UI episodes. These were  recorded in a final 3-day diary. DR-3001 4   mg/d and 6   mg/d  showed significantly greater improvement vs placebo in weekly  UI  episodes  (mean  change  from  baseline:  –20.5  and  –21.4  vs  –18.1,  P = 0.0013  and  P , 0.0001,  respectively)  and  daily  urinary frequency (mean change from baseline: –2.0 and –3.2  vs –2.0,  P = 0.0005 and  P , 0.0001, respectively). No significant  differences were noted between DR-3001 4   mg/d and 6   mg/d  vs placebo in terms of urinary void volume (mean change from  baseline: 25.4 and 23.6 vs 18.8,  P = NS). DR-3001 4   mg/d and  6   mg/d also had a greater proportion of women with no UI  episodes recorded in the final 3-day diary (36% and 35% vs  28%,  P = 0.029 and  P = 0.074, respectively). Except for a higher  incidence of dry mouth, DR-3001 was well tolerated and had  a safety profile similar to that of the placebo ring. In fact, dry  mouth  occurred  in  6%  of  cases  with  DR-3001  4   mg/d,  8%  with  DR-3001  6   mg/d,  and  4%  with  placebo;  constipation  occurred in 1%, 1%, and 2% of cases with DR-3001 4   mg/d,  DR-3001 6   mg/d, and placebo, respectively; culture-positive  UTIs occurred in 8%, 10%, and 8% of cases with DR-3001  4   mg/d, DR-3001 6   mg/d, and placebo, respectively. 32 Local delivery methods Bladder anatomy allows relatively easy and direct delivery  of drugs through a catheter, allowing the drug to reach the  target  site  with  minimal  side  effects  while  avoiding  first- pass metabolism. Intravesical administration of oxybutynin  compared to oral showed higher bioavailability, with reduced  concentration of its active metabolite  N -DEO. 33 Dysfunction  of  the  GAG  layer  is  the  most  currently  accepted theory for IC. Hence, the use of IDD might be ratio - nal because oral therapy requires large doses and only a small  portion is actually absorbed and reaches the bladder. 34,35 </p>
