This article is reprinted from the British Journal of Nursing, 2013 (Urology Supplement), Vol 22, No 9 Painful bladder syndrome    and interstitial cystitis:    treatment options Natalie Fiander BJN_22_9_BAUN Supp_Cystistat.indd   1 05/07/2013   12:23 </p>
                                        
                                            <p>6. Riedl et al (2008) demonstrated a response rate of 84%  symptom improvement and quality of life in patients given  Cystistat weekly, although 35% had symptom recurrence after  discontinuing treatment.  Engelhardt et al   (2011) investigated the long-term  effects of hyaluronic acid instillations by reporting on a  questionnaire completed by 48 patients with a history  of PBS/IC who had undergone intravesical instillations  in 2001-2003. Fifty percent of the patients had stayed  symptom-free with no additional treatment 5 years on,  while 41.7% had experienced symptom relapse within  the first year but subsequently remained symptom-free  with hyaluronic acid maintenance and no other treatment.  Hüther et al (2011) found that intravesical hyaluronic  acid increased GAG synthesis and reduced the level of  inflammation. Arance et al (2013) found during comparison  of different types of intravesical treatment that Cystistat in  higher numbers of 10-12 instillations was associated with  maximum efficacy. Lai et al (2013) compared two different  regimens of Cystistat instillation in 60 patients; 30 received  12 instillations every 2 weeks and 30 received instillations  weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 5 months. There  was a significant improvement in symptom scores and  quality of life index in both groups and the only significant  difference was a slight improvement in frequency and  voided volumes in those receiving 12 instillations.  In addition to its use in treating the symptoms of PBS/ IC, there is evidence to support the use of Cystistat in  treating radiation induced cystitis (Delgado et al, 2003;  Sommariva, 2010) and in the reduction of or prophylaxis  against recurrent UTIs (Lipovac et al, 2007; Raymond et  al, 2012). The main limitation of these studies is the small  sample size and variations in the outcome measures used.  Further larger-scale studies and randomised controlled trials  are still needed.  Costs of instillations with Cystistat need to be balanced  against the economic impact of PBS/IC if the condition is  not managed and progresses towards major surgery, which is  often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is  also worth noting from the literature that patients can often  ‘relapse’ if treatment is stopped completely. This is likely to  mean that they will require further instillations on a weekly  basis to bring symptoms back under control and it may  therefore be more cost-effective to continue on long term  maintenance.  Following investigation, diagnosis and initiation of  Cystistat treatment in secondary care, Cystistat will be  available on FP10 from April 2013 in order that GPs can  prescribe the product in primary care, facilitating better  access for patients and promoting self-care strategies. The  NHS list price is£98 per vial.  Patient case study 1 Christine (pseudonym) was a 38-year-old woman   diagnosed  with interstitial cystitis in 2010 following a bladder biopsy.  She attended hospital for a discussion regarding Cystistat  instillations and was very cautious and fearful about the  process as she was experiencing a lot of pain and was  very concerned that catheterisation would be extremely  uncomfortable. She declined treatment initially but was  referred back by her GP when she began to have a dreadful  time with her bladder symptoms after taking on a new  role at work. Christine agreed to instillations and tolerated  these very well, but after 4 weeks, although there had been  a small improvement, this was not to the degree she had  hoped. It was therefore agreed that weekly instillations  would continue due to this initial marginal improvement.  Following 8 instillations at weekly intervals,   Christine  reported a significant improvement and the period between  her instillations was increased to monthly but her symptoms  quickly returned. It was agreed to try weekly treatments for  2 weeks then after this, the intervals were increased much  more slowly. Christine received treatment fortnightly for 2  months, then 3 weekly. It was eventually possible to increase  intervals to monthly maintenance instillation. This particular  patient highlighted that it is important to assess each patient’s  individual response to treatment as a ‘one size fits all’  approach is not always adequate. As Christine had shown a  good response to Cystistat it was worth persevering with the  treatment and adjusting the intervals slightly, as in this case 4  weekly instillations followed by monthly instillations would  not have been effective. Patient case study 2 Ellen (pseudonym) was a 26-year-old woman who was  initially referred to a gynaecologist with vaginismus, which  was given a psychological cause and she was referred for  psychosexual counselling and physiotherapy. After working  with her the physiotherapist she discovered that the  vaginismus was caused by pain Ellen experienced during  intercourse. Ellen also reported several years’ history of  UTIs. The physiotherapist who saw Ellen fortunately  specialised in women’s health and had seen patients with  PBS/IC before. Therefore, she had a high index of suspicion  and Ellen was referred to the author and her team. She  initially presented with a lot of anxiety and was very low  in mood. On discussion with her about Cystistat, Ellen  agreed to the instillations and was keen to start these straight  away. It took 5 weeks to get her symptoms under control  and Ellen was much improved in her mood and reporting  a significant improvement in her symptoms. However she  experienced a flare in her symptoms, which had a negative  impact on her progress. Once this was under control, Ellen  was very keen to avoid reverting back to her original  symptoms and would become very anxious about symptom  flares, especially over a bank holiday weekend or when she  was going away anywhere in case she had a flare and could  not get an instillation. This was discussed and Ellen agreed  to be taught self-catheterisation in order to instil her own  Cystistat. She was very surprised to find how simple this  was and still continues to instil Cystistat on a monthly basis  which seems to keep her symptoms under control. She does  experience flares occasionally but generally is coping very  well and is able to instil her Cystistat slightly more often  during symptom flare, which helps her to feel more in  control of her symptoms and worry less about her flare ups.  This self-management is very important to the patient in  managing her pain and gives her a feeling of independence.

PRODUCT FOCUS This article is reprinted from the British Journal of Nursing, 2013 ( Urology   Supplement ), Vol 22, No 9 PBS/IC will often present with other concomitant conditions.  such as irritable bowel syndrome, vulvodynia, fibromyalgia,  endometriosis, asthma, migraines, sensitive skin/allergies and  functional disorders of the immune system. The association  of PBS/IC, particularly with autoimmune conditions such  as Sjogren’s syndrome and fibromyalgia, has led to discussion  about PBS/IC as an autoimmune condition, but this is not  proven (Warren et al, 2011).  Non-invasive treatment options European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on  chronic pelvic pain (Engeler et al, 2013) recommend initially  using conservative treatments and assessing response. Bladder  retraining is only likely to be a realistic option in patients  whose most bothersome symptom is frequency rather than  pain. Dietary and fluid modifications are also a commonly  used strategy in the management of PBS/IC. Several foods  and drinks, including coffee, tea, carbonated drinks, alcohol,  citrus fruits and juices, artificial sweeteners and hot peppers  can exacerbate symptoms (Shorter et al, 2007; Warren et  al, 2008b; Lohsiriwat et al, 2011) and the PBS/IC Ad Hoc  Committee on Diet has published a list of ‘bladder- and  prostate-friendly foods’ to help patients identify and avoid  foods that may trigger symptoms or affect treatment (IC/ PBS Ad Hoc Committee on Diet, 2009). The American  Urological Association (AUA) advises use of elimination  strategies to help in identifying triggers within the diet,  followed by avoidance of these trigger foods/fluids (Hanno et  al, 2011). Studies have shown that patients are able to identify  triggers for their pain or symptom flares, particularly highly  acidic foods or those high in certain types of amino acid  (Marshall, 2003). However, dietary restriction alone does not  produce complete symptomatic relief.  Acute and chronic stress causes many physiological  processes and the stress-response releases molecules that  may aggravate the symptoms of PBS/IC causing a flare  (Godfrey and Hanno, 2007). Therefore stress-relieving  activities such as yoga or meditation may have a role in  symptom management.  Pain is often a dominant symptom; many patients try  commonly used analgesics but the visceral pain experienced  in PBS/IC responds poorly to analgesic drugs. Opioids may  be considered after all other available therapeutic options  have been exhausted. However, opioid-induced side-effects  are undesirable (Engeler et al, 2013). Furthermore, PBS/IC  is a chronic condition, meaning that these drugs will need  to be administered fairly frequently and therefore the risk of  tolerance and dependency may become an issue.  There is limited evidence to suggest that the H 2 -blocker  cimetidine improves symptoms in PBS/IC, although better  results were seen in patients taking higher doses of 400 mg  twice daily (Seshadri et al, 1994; Lewi, 1995).  Antimuscarinics may improve functional bladder capacity  but evidence does not suggest any effect on pain (Barbalias et  al, 2000).  Several studies have suggested improvement in symptoms  with oral amitriptyline. However, this can be associated  with drowsiness (Foster et al, 2010). When all efforts fail to  relieve disabling symptoms, surgical removal of the diseased  bladder is the final option (Oberpenning et al, 2002; Loch  and Stein, 2004). Cystistat Cystistat (sodium hyaluronate) is a localised treatment for  PBS/IC. Other bladder conditions, e.g. radiation-induced  cystitis, chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections that  relate to a defective GAG layer, may also benefit from  treatment with Cystistat. Cystistat is licensed as a medical  device for temporary replenishment of the GAG layer.  It is recommended that Cystistat is initially administered  once weekly for 4-6 consecutive weeks, then the interval  between treatments can be increased, dependent upon the  individual patient’s response, ideally aiming for a monthly  (or less frequent) maintenance dose. Cystistat is administered  intravesically as a 50ml instillation via an intermittent catheter  and bladder syringe. Residual urine is removed during the  process of intermittent catheterisation. The bladder syringe  containing 50ml of Cystistat can then be attached and  administered and should be retained in the bladder for a  minimum of 30 minutes. Patients can leave immediately  and void the product in any suitable environment at their  convenience. Cystistat has a very low incidence of side-effects  and sodium hyaluronate is a naturally occurring substance.  Given the high molecular weight of Cystistat, absorption  from the bladder is unlikely.  Cystistat has been shown to be effective in treating PBS/ IC symptoms of frequency and pain. Morales et al (1997)  investigated the activity of hyaluronic acid in the treatment  of BPS/IC in 25 patients who were refractory to other  medical treatment, finding a 56% positive response at week4,  increasing to 71% by week 12 of treatment. Kallestrup et al  (2005) conducted a study to determine whether hyaluronic  acid was effective in reducing the urinary frequency and pain  associated with PBS/IC. In a prospective, uncontrolled study,  20 patients received weekly instillations of hyaluronic acid  for 1 month then monthly for a further 2 months. There  was a mean decrease in nocturia and pain of 40% and 30%  respectively. Nordling et al (2001) and Kallestrup et al (2005)  have both reported 3-year follow-up of this initial study.  Eleven of the 20 patients continued treatment beyond the  initial trial, and modest beneficial long-term effects were  noted in about two-thirds of patients.  Daha et al (2005) demonstrated that hyaluronic acid  had an effect on pain reduction in 48 patients treated  with weekly instillations of hyaluronic acid for 10 weeks.  Symptom relief due to hyaluronic acid therapy was identified  irrespective of bladder capacity. Ahmad et al (2008) suggested  that hydrodistention and hyaluronic acid therapy may be  carried out together under general anaesthetic (GA) for  resistant cases of PBS/IC. Twenty-three patients refractory  to other treatments underwent cystoscopy, hydrodistention  and hyaluronic acid instillation under GA. The bladder  was then drained when patients were awake. Seventy-four  percent of patients reported immediate improvement of  symptoms and the average anaesthetic bladder capacity  increased in this group from 492ml to 776ml. Shao et al  (2010) also demonstrated that Cystistat can prolong the  effects of hydrodistension in patients with severe symptoms.

Numerous factors have been implicated but  PBS/IC is still thought to be multifactorial (Teichman and  Moldwin, 2007). There are difficulties associated with research  into the causes of PBS/IC, which have made it difficult to  identify an exact cause (Kurth, 2004) but different hypotheses  include subclinical infection, inflammation, mast cell activation  and autoimmune mechanisms (Engeler et al, 2013). It has been  suggested that an initial unidentified injury to the bladder  triggers inflammatory, endocrine and neural changes and a  central cell for the initiation of the inflammation is the mast  cell. On identifying a threat (which may occur if a defective  GAG layer allows noxious substances to come into contact  with the urothelium), urothelial cells activate mast cells. Mast  cell number and activity is significantly increased in patients  with PBS/IC (Theoharides, 2005). Mast cells release histamine,  which directs white blood cells out of the blood vessels and  into the tissue to deal with the offending molecule. Mast cells  in the bladder also have oestrogen receptors and oestrogen  increases their activation, perhaps explaining the increased pain  some women experience during ovulation and menstruation  (Marshall, 2003). Stress may have a role in activating bladder  mast cells (Theoharides, 2005). It is also thought that sensory  nerve fibres within the bladder can become inflamed as a result  of mast cell activation, causing neuropathic pain (Twiss et al,  2007) and increased sensory nerve fibres have been found  in patients with PBS/IC (Butrick et al, 2010).

PRODUCT FOCUS This article is reprinted from the British Journal of Nursing, 2013 ( Urology   Supplement ), Vol 22, No 9 and in particular, no bacterial cause or infection has been  implicated in PBS/IC. Equal UTI frequency has been  found in PBS/IC patients and controls (Al-Hadithi et al,  2005; Warren et al, 2008a); antibiotics are not an effective  treatment; they may be associated with decreased symptoms  in some patients, but do not represent a major advance in  therapy (Warren et al, 2000).  Symptoms of PBS/IC/impact on the individual In 2009, The Cystitis and Overactive Bladder (COB)  Foundation carried out a survey of members who had a  diagnosis of PBS/IC. Eighty-eight percent of respondents  stated that increased urinary frequency was the most  common symptom occurring as a result of their PBS/IC,  while 86% of responders reported pain in the stomach,  bladder or urethra. Ninety-five percent of responders have  suffered from depression at some point, while 49% frequently  suffer from depression. Sixty-one percent stated that pain was  the worst symptom of PBS/IC. The survey also confirmed  significant issues relating to sleep deprivation, impact on  travel or holiday arrangements, socialising, sexual intimacy  and work/career for those with PBS/IC. There may be  significant economic impact on patients if symptoms are  not managed successfully and they may need to adjust their  working patterns. PBS/IC is clearly associated with lower  health-related quality of life, poor sleep and increased anxiety,  stress and depression compared with controls (Clemens et al,  2007; Nickel et al, 2010).  In severe cases or during symptom ‘flare’ pain may be  constant and frequency up to 60 times a day, making it  very difficult for the patient to leave the house or work  (Marshall, 2003). As the cause of the condition has not  been identified and there is no cure, treatment planning  must instead focus on helping to relieve symptoms and  assisting the patient to manage the condition successfully  to a degree where their quality of life returns to as near  to normal as possible for them. This can be a particular  challenge as PBS/IC is a chronic condition that is not  well recognised and patients and health professionals  may have difficulty communicating about the condition  successfully to others who may need to be informed  (i.e. the patient’s GP, employer, family and friends).    Dickinson (2006) suggests that urological nurses often  become primary caregivers for PBS/IC patients and  have an important role in symptom management. It  is common for symptoms to wax and wane over time  (McDermott, 2009). If patients experience a period of  almost complete symptom relief that allows them to almost  forget they have the condition, this may be followed by  a severe flare in symptoms. Patients can then struggle to  adjust and become very distressed that they still have the  condition, and this distress may actually exacerbate the  flare. Treatment progresses from conservative management  through various oral and intravesical therapies, with major  surgical procedures reserved for unresponsive cases.  The healthy bladder, the GAG layer and PBS/IC The healthy bladder is protected by two mechanisms, the  first of which is the downward flushing micturition process  itself. The bladder is also lined internally with protein and  sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which  create a mucous layer (GAG layer) that coats the bladder and  repels anything that may cause damage or irritation to the  bladder wall. The GAG layer also has an important role in  the defence of bladder urothelium by preventing bacterial  adherence (Hurst et al, 2007). Urine solutes are not meant  to interact with the bladder during the storage phase. The  GAG layer provides the primary barrier for controlling  the interactions of the bladder with urine and is therefore  vital in the prevention of disease states (Parsons, 2007;  Madersbacher and Oeconomou, 2009). Endoscopic findings  and biopsy results show that the GAG layer is inadequately  developed, defective or dysfunctional in most patients with  IC (Parsons, 2007; Teichman and Moldwin, 2007). GAG layer  defects lead to direct exposure of the bladder mucosa and  submucosal nerve endings to urine, which is likely to trigger  an inflammatory reaction in the bladder wall due to the  high content of potassium ions and other irritants contained  within urine (Metts, 2001; Chancellor and Yoshimura, 2004;  Theoharides, 2005; Hurst et al, 2007; Parsons et al, 2007).  The mucous layer of the bladder consists of GAGs such  as chondroitin sulphate, hyaluronic acid and heparin and  therefore rationale exists for intravesical treatments that act  locally to bind to the damaged GAG layer (Theoharides,  2005). GAG layer replacement has the broadest evidence  base to support its use and is considered a first choice therapy  (Kurth, 2004). As treatment is not absorbed systemically there  are only local side-effects. An example of a GAG replacement  product will be discussed later. Figure 1.

                                            <p>2. Painful bladder syndrome and  interstitial cystitis: treatment options Abstract Painful bladder syndrome (PBS) and interstitial cystitis (IC) are  associated with bladder pain, increased urinary frequency, urgency and  reduced quality of life. The cause is still unknown, although there are  several possible hypotheses. PBS/IC may significantly impact all areas  of a patient’s life as they try to manage their symptoms. Treatment  options usually involve diet and fluid modifications, oral medications,  intravesical therapy or as a last resort, surgery. The bladder is protected  by a mucous layer known as the GAG layer and is thought to protect  the underlying urothelium from coming into contact with potassium  ions and other irritants contained in urine. Due to research suggesting  that sufferers of PBS/IC have dysfunctional GAG layers, there is  rationale for intravesical GAG replacement therapy as a treatment  option in reducing PBS/IC symptoms such as pain, frequency and  urgency. Early diagnosis and treatment may lead to better long-term  outcomes. Key words:    n  Painful bladder syndrome   n  Interstitial cystitis   n  GAG  layer   n  Cystistat   n  Catheterisation P ainful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC)  is defined as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure,  discomfort) related to the urinary bladder, associated  with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) of  more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection  or other identifiable causes (Hanno et al, 2011). PBS/IC is  characterised by bladder pain, urinary frequency, urgency  and nocturia (Dasgupta and Tincello, 2009). The European  Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on chronic pelvic  pain state that the pain is usually located suprapubically and  sometimes radiates to the groin, vagina or penis and testicles,  rectum or sacrum. Pain can be relieved by voiding but returns  quickly and may be aggravated by certain food or drink. Pelvic  pain is thought to be a key factor in diagnosing the condition  (Engeler et al, 2013). Pain during sexual intercourse is a  commonly reported symptom (Gardella et al, 2008). Background The term ‘interstitial cystitis’ was first used in the late 19th  and early 20th century to describe a disease process causing  Natalie Fiander patches of ulceration, pus and haemorrhages within the  bladder that eventually progressed to cause the destruction  of portions of the mucous membrane (Parsons and Parsons,  2004). In recent years, authors have differentiated between this  ‘classic’ appearance of the disease and what has been referred  to as ‘non-ulcer’ disease (Peeker and Fall, 2002). ‘Classic’  disease is often associated with blood vessels radiating towards  a central ulcerated or scarred area known as the Hunner’s  ulcer, clearly visible on cystoscopy and what was probably  first described as ‘interstitial cystitis’. The scar may rupture  following overdistension of the bladder under anaesthetic  (hydrodistension), producing a characteristic type of bleeding  like a waterfall, which is considered a positive diagnostic sign.  Classic/ulcer disease is thought to be a highly damaging  inflammation that often leads to a small-capacity, fibrotic  bladder (Rossberger et al, 2007). However, the majority of  patients present with non-ulcer disease. Patients with this  type of disease are symptomatic but abnormalities may be  subtle or absent on cystoscopy, although hydrodistension  may demonstrate a lower anaesthetic bladder capacity and  submucosal haemorrhages (Amrute and Moldwin, 2007).  It is thought that only 5-10% of patients have classic/ulcer  disease (Nickel, 2004). In recent years, to account more accurately for all patients  suffering from bladder pain, there have been recommendations  that the term ‘painful bladder syndrome’ is used in place of  ‘interstitial cystitis’ and only once any obvious cause for  ongoing LUTS (such as infection, cancer, or structural  abnormality etc) has been ruled out. PBS is believed to be a  preferable term to ‘interstitial cystitis’, because it is believed/ assumed that classic/ulcer IC is a specific type of chronic  inflammation of the bladder and requires confirmation using  cystoscopic and histological findings (van de Merwe et al,  2008). However, The Bladder Pain Syndrome Committee  of the International Consultation on Incontinence reviewed  PBS/IC comprehensively and agreed that the disorder is  best viewed as one of a group of chronic pain syndromes,  rather than primarily as an inflammatory bladder disorder  (Hanno et al, 2010). The terms are still used interchangeably  in practice despite this guidance. PBS/IC is a long-term, chronic condition that is often  poorly understood or unrecognised and misdiagnosed. It  is common for patients to report many years of bladder  symptoms before receiving a diagnosis (Kroon  and  Reginald,  2005; McDermott, 2009) and in practice patients may have  received recurrent courses of antibiotics for presumed  bacterial cystitis before being referred for investigation.

PRODUCT FOCUS This article is reprinted from the British Journal of Nursing, 2013 ( Urology   Supplement ), Vol 22, No 9 Patient case study 3 James (pseudonym)was a 41-year-old man who was referred  by his GP to a urologist with symptoms of severe frequency,  urgency and microscopic haematuria. He was struggling  significantly to manage at work and had stopped socialising  and travelling due to his symptoms. He underwent flexible  cystoscopy and a scan; all haematuria investigations were  returned/reported as normal. James was diagnosed with  an overactive bladder and sent to the continence service.  After no success with bladder retraining techniques or  antimuscarinic medication and on reviewing James’  frequency chart, his functional bladder capacity remained  at approximately 100ml. He was referred for urodynamic  studies and on filling his bladder to 156 ml James reported  a lot of pain. He was subsequently sent for cystoscopy and  hydrodistention under general anaesthetic. Upon second  filling James was noted to have petechial haemorrhages  consistent with possible IC. His bladder capacity was also  small at about 250mls and hydrodistension was performed.  Despite placing the irrigation fluid at a fairly high level, the  bladder could only be distended to 350ml or so and would  not distend any further. Following hydrodistension James’  bladder was extremely uncomfortable and his functional  capacity was assessed at between 30 ml and 70 ml.  Instillation of the first dose of intravesical Cystistat was  started a few weeks later and James received 6 weekly  treatments then treatments 2-3 weeks apart. He has recently  started receiving monthly maintenance doses and his most  recent frequency chart shows his bladder capacity is now at  200 mls and his bladder pain is under very good control. He  is much happier with his symptoms. Other treatments Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is a chemical solvent found  to alleviate symptoms in PBS/IC (Sant and LaRock,  1994; Rössberger et al, 2005). It temporarily causes a  garlic-like odour, which can cause patients to be put off  treatment. Vanilloids disrupt sensory neurons (Chancellor,  2001) and resiniferatoxin (RTX) has been shown to  significantly reduce mean frequency, nocturia, pain and  bladder capacity. However, all studies report significant  pain during instillation (Chen et al, 2005). Although  bladder hydrodistension is a common treatment for  PBS/IC it has a limited therapeutic role and if there is  improvement in symptoms this is likely to be short-lived  (Erickson et al, 2007). There are some small scale studies to  suggest that percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)  may have a role in symptom relief in PBS/IC (Zhao and  Nordling, 2004; Zhao et al, 2008).  Conclusion PBS/IC presents a challenge to the clinician and patient, as  symptoms can impact severely on quality of life and can only  be managed rather than cured. Significant evidence is  available to suggest that GAG layer deficiency is very  common in patients with PBS and IC and this makes GAG  replacement therapy a sensible option. In addition to being  cost-effective (Department of Health, 2006), Cystistat is  appropriate to GP and, if relevant, nurse prescribing. It is a  quick, straightforward and safe treatment option for GAG  replacement therapy and, following appropriate diagnosis and  initiation in secondary care, patients can be taught to instill  Cystistat at home by a specialist if it is inconvenient to travel  to an outpatient clinic on a frequent basis. This independence  can be very valuable in terms of empowering patients to  manage their own symptoms and adjusting to/learning to live  with PBS/IC and this should improve further with the  availability of Cystistat on FP10.
