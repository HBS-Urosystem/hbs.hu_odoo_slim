Similarly, Daha  et al.  published an open, uncontrolled  study involving 29 women who underwent intravesical PPS  therapy (33). Improvements in O’Leary Sant score were  noted after 10 biweekly treatments of 300 mg intravesical  PPS. This supports the theory that intravesical PPS can be  of therapeutic value, though further higher level of evidence  research is required. New therapies on the horizon The latest advance in intravesical therapy for interstitial  cystitis involves the use of intravesical liposomes. In other  aspects of medicine, liposomes have been found to have  wound healing properties by providing a moisture film on  the wound, without promoting an inflammatory reaction.  Biophysical studies have found that liposomes can be  adsorbed, fuse or transfer lipids to the cell membrane, as well  as endocytose to the cell interior. Certain constituents of  liposomes have been demonstrated to contribute to epithelial  membrane impermeability, as well as modulate inflammation. Liposomes Liposomal therapy has become increasingly promising  for potential mainstream application (34). Liposomes are  essentially fat bubbles formed by phospholipid bilayers  which contain water.  They theoretically create a film onto the bladder  urothelium when instilled, forming a mechanical barrier. It  has been found to decrease inflammation and irritation in  IC bladders (35) and is postulated to restore the GAG layer  with a 50% response rate (11).  The current regime for liposomal treatment is a weekly  instillation of 80 mg of preliposomal sphingomyelin  lyophilate with 40 mL of sterile water (36) for 4 weeks. The  solution is retained in the bladder for 30 minutes or more  before being evacuated by the patient after catheter removal. Two promising studies have been performed with  liposomes, the first being Chuang  et al.  in 2009 (37) where  the response of intravesical liposome therapy was compared  to oral PPS. Twenty-four patients were prospectively followed,  half had 80 mg of liposomal therapy instilled for 4 weeks whilst  the other treatment arm was given 300 mg of oral PPS daily.  Outcomes were measured using the O’Leary Sant score, visual  analog and GRAs at 4 and 8 weeks post treatment. Statistically  significant improvements (50% of participants) in urinary  urgency and pain were noted at 4 weeks, which remained  effective at 8 weeks. Urinary frequency and nocturia scores  were comparable to the PPS group. Peters  et al.  in 2014 (36) followed 14 IC patients who  underwent weekly instillations of liposomes for 4 weeks.  Outcomes were measured via the VAS (visual analog scales),  O’Leary Sant Index and GRAs. Cystoscopic improvements  were noted in three participants, no change in 10 and  worsening in 1 participant. No adverse side effects were  noted and outcomes were positive with improvements in  pain, urgency and overall symptoms scores. Improvements  in urgency were sustained at 8 weeks. Although pain scores  significantly improved at 4 weeks, they were found to be  back to baseline at 8 weeks. With no reportable side effects and a relatively  high response rate, liposomal therapy requires further  investigation to determine if the 50% response rate is  repeatable in a larger randomised control study. With  similar response rates to PPS, intravesical instillation of  liposomes provides an avenue which bypasses potential  systemic side effects or allergies whilst providing high local  drug concentrations at the site of injury. Conclusions The aetiology of IC is not well understood. It is postulated  that bladder urothelium dysfunction causes the chronic  inflammation and bladder hypersensitivity seen in IC.  Current therapies have attempted to target this GAG  layer, but no study to date has been associated with a full  remission. This suggests at best only partial repair to  the damaged barrier. Because the agents are not directly  anti-inflammatory they may not reverse the secondary  submucosal inflammation and thus, have to-date failed to  fully eradicate bladder pain. The initial assault is believed to be caused by an infection.  A breakthrough in this theory occurred when Zhang  et al.   from China isolated nanobacteria in bladder tissue samples  of IC and noted symptom improvement and decreased  levels of nanobacteria after tetracycline treatment (38).    Lower concentrations of uromodulin and kininogens, and  higher levels of intertrypsin inhibitor H4 were also revealed on  proteomic analysis in patients with IC. With this breakthrough,  the future of IC therapy may be heading towards targeting  these proteins. However, it is important to note that systematic  use of anti-microbials has been ineffective.  Other studies have found IC urine contain increased  </p>

In addition, participants  were commonly found to experience adverse systemic  symptoms (e.g., arthritis) which subsided once treatment  was ceased. In rare cases, BCG has been reported to cause  life threatening septic reactions (10). With significant risks and a low therapeutic benefit,  BCG therapy has been phased out as an effective means of  treating IC. As shown in  Table 2,  The American Urological  Association (AUA) has classed this as an −A therapy,  recommending against its use due to these downfalls (11).    Of the intravesical agents this is perhaps the most  comprehensively studied highlighting the early stage in the  evolution of this disease and its therapies.  Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)  Similar to BCG, the mechanism of action of DMSO is not  fully known. It is thought to be a scavenger of intracellular  hydroxyl radicals which are postulated to be important  triggers of the inflammatory response. DMSO has also  been reported to stimulate nitric oxide release from  afferent neurons, possibly reflecting the desensitisation of  nociceptive pathways in the urinary tract (12). These mechanisms work to reduce inflammation, relax  the detrusor muscle, provide mast-cell inhibition and  dissolve collagen. It may also cause temporary urothelial  injury, potentially allowing better penetration for other  intravesical agents and is being increasingly used in  conjunction with other agents. Thus far, no combination of  agents has been found superior to another. Currently, it is  the intravesical treatment of choice in IC. The treatment regime traditionally involves weekly  bladder instillations of 50 mL of 50% DMSO solution  for 6–8 weeks. The solution is retained in the bladder for  10–20 minutes at each instillation. After the initial course,  treatment is suspended until a recurrence occurs.  The main side effect is a “garlic” breath odour for 2 days  post instillation. Patient also report pain on instillation and  catheter irritation (13). Initially, patients may notice a flare-up    of symptoms but this settles throughout the course of  treatment. Studies have found a 50% response rate with  DMSO intravesical therapy and it is currently the mainstay  of treatment.  Only two randomised controlled trials have been  performed thus far to assess DMSO outcomes. Perez- Marrero  et al.  randomised 33 patients with IC to 50 mL of  50% DMSO therapy or saline placebo (14). Subsequently  fortnightly instillations were given, for a total of four  sessions and then participants were assessed. Primary  outcomes measured were pain, urgency and bladder  capacity. Ninety-three percent of DMSO  vs.  35% of  placebo patients noted objective improvements. Subjectively  53% of DMSO patients noted significant improvement  compared to 13% of placebo patients. This 1988 study set  the precedent for DMSO use for IC. In 2000, Peeker  et al.  compared DMSO to BCG therapy (7)    in a prospective, double-blind study. Twenty-one patients  were randomised to 50 mL of 50% DMSO or 1 mL BCG  (in 49 mL saline); solutions were given in six weekly sessions.  Improvements were noted in the DMSO group in both urinary  frequency and pain for classic IC, whereas nil improvement  was noted in the BCG group. There was an improvement in  VAS pain score for non-ulcerative IC after DMSO, but no  change in other study outcomes.  No improvement was noted  in maximal functional capacity for both therapies.  The evidence at the moment is supportive of DMSO  therapy for the management of IC but it is not conclusive.  In practice, only a proportion of patients respond and  mostly the responses are partial rather than complete or  permanent. This is likely due to the multifactorial and  progressive nature of the disease although DMSO is a non- specific therapy targeting a complex chronic inflammatory  disease. In an attempt to target the different components  of IC and its manifestations, multiagent intravesical  therapy has been trialled (15), where 65.5% of IC patients  responded to 50% DMSO, 100 mg hydrocortisone and  25,000 IU heparin in eight weekly instillations. Of note,  high levels of treatment failure were noted in patients with  advanced disease states—that is, those who had severe  cystoscopic glomerulations, microscopic haematuria and  urodynamic detrusor underactivity. Thus, other more  effective avenues of treatment still need to be explored.

All rights reserved. levels of antiproliferative factor which plays a role in  inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation in the bladder (39).    IC bladders also appear to contain epithelial cells which  produce an inhibitor of heparin-binding epidermal  growth factor-like protein. Both these mechanisms reduce  urothelial proliferation in the IC bladder. This inhibition is  possibly modulated by currently unidentified genes. IC/BPS is a multifaceted condition with likely multiple  aetiologies and pathological pathways. It is little wonder  that many therapeutic efforts seem to be effective for  some and not others. In the spectrum of BPS, IC is still  a pathophysiological enigma and its treatment empirical,  though it fits within the paradigm of chronic regional pain  syndrome. It is considered a multifactorial cascade of events  that culminate into an imbalance of the damage-repair  process of the urothelium, leading to deficiency of the GAG  layer and resulting symptoms. From the abnormal urothelial  permeability, sensory nerve stimulation and mast cell  activation, this complex process contributes to the chronicity  of IC and the unsatisfactory response to treatment. Despite widespread empirical use of intravesical agents,  the evidence of efficacy is in an early phase of its evolution.  Studies such as the BCG trials do show it is possible to  conduct RCT studies in the patient cohort. Most studies are  uncontrolled, with small numbers and open methodology.  There is a paucity of large randomised controlled trials in  this field, the gold standard in clinical research, thus not yet  enabling us to fully relieve suffering in patients with IC.

Combined chondroitin + HA (iAluRil) Although there is no support for Sodium Chondroitin  efficacy, combined therapy of 1.6% hyaluronic and 2%  chondroitin intravesical instillation therapy has shown  promise. It is currently marketed as iAluRil. A course of iAluRil consists of 40 mL of sodium  hyaluronic 1.6% and chondroitin sulfate 2.0% in normal  saline. This mixture is instilled intravesically weekly for    8 weeks, then as required (24). A 2008 prospective, open and uncontrolled study by  Cervigni  et al. , followed 23 women who received weekly  instillations of iAluRil for 20 weeks, followed by monthly  instillations for 3 months (23). Patients were then followed  up for 5 months post completion of treatment to determine  sustainability. Outcomes were measured using the O’Leary- Sant index, voiding diaries and Visual Analogue scales.  Improvements were noted in frequency, urgency and pain. These findings were corroborated by Porru  et al.  in  a 2011 study with 22 patients who received 8 weekly  instillations, followed by fortnightly for 6 months (24).  Voiding volumes, urinary urgency and pain all improved,  though in varying degrees, in all patients. In 2012, Cervigni  et al.  published the long term  outcomes of iAluRil over a period of 3 years (30). Twelve  patients were treated over a 3-year period and evaluated  with positive findings. Patients noted improvements in  frequency, void volumes and quality of life. These results indicate that sodium chondroitin is of  benefit when used in combination with HA, but is not  beneficial as a monotherapy. Of note, iAluRil studies have  not noted any significant side effects with the use of this  combined therapy.  Further studies are required with larger controlled  studies to validate these results but there appears to be  promise with GAG targeted therapy. Heparinoid compounds Heparin + AL Heparin is a polysaccharide which is one of the components  of the GAG layer. Similar to the above GAG therapies,  heparin acts as an endogenous GAG when it is instilled  intravesically. Theoretically, it restores some of the bladder  urothelium’s natural function, which is damaged in IC.  A typical course of heparin involves instilling 10,000– 40,000 IU in 10 mL of water, 3 times a week with a retention  time of 1 hour. Patients are treated for 3 months, with further  maintenance therapy offered if improvement is noted (11). In 1994, Parsons  et al.  treated 48 patients with the above  intravesical heparin regime (31). Results were positive with  56% reporting improvement, though no long term follow- up was recorded. No randomised controlled study has been  performed on heparin monotherapy to verify these results. Intravesical heparin therapy does not provide immediate  symptom relief, therefore it is being increasingly paired  with AL which provides short term relief in the interim.  The lidocaine is alkalinised to avoid ionisation with the  acidic urine. AL is postulated to readily diffuse through the  bladder epithelium and anaesthetise the afferent sensory  C-fibres. Heparin potentiates the efficacy of lidocaine by  coating the bladder wall and blocking potassium efficacy. Parsons  et al.  conducted a multicentre prospective, double  blind, crossover study in 2012 with heparin + lidocaine with  positive results (5). Eighteen patients underwent a double- blind controlled study, where they were randomised to  receive either 50,000 units of heparin, 200 mg of lidocaine  and 420 mg sodium bicarbonate in 15 mL of water or 420 mg  of sodium bicarbonate in 15 mL of water. A 42% reduction  in pain was noted in the immediate time period. Currently the long term sustainability and benefit of  heparin is unknown. Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) Traditionally, PPS is given as an oral agent at a dose of  300 mg/day for 8 months. It is the only FDA approved IC  drug in America. Studies experimenting with intravesical  PPS instillation have shown some promise, but cohorts  have been small and a large randomised controlled study  is required. The theoretical benefit postulates as PPS is  similar in structure to the GAG layer, this agent may help  restore the urothelial mucosal layer. When instilled intravesically, 200–300 mg of oral PPS  is dissolved in 30 mL of normal saline. The solution is  administered weekly for a total of 6 weeks, with top up  therapy given as required. Davis  et al.  performed a blinded  trial involving 41 women who were randomly allocated to be  given oral and intravesical PPS or oral PPS and intravesical  placebo of normal saline (32). Six weeks of weekly intravesical  therapy were given, and oral PPS was continued for 12 weeks  in both groups. The O’Leary Sant index was used to measure  outcomes. A 46% reduction in O’Leary Sant score was noted  </p>

Overview  Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is  a chronic, progressive disorder first described in the turn  of the century by Boston gynaecologist, Guy Hunners  who defined the characteristics of the disease (1). He  also described the “Hunner Ulcer”, which is the typical  cystoscopic finding of classic IC. There is now increasing  evidence that there are two subtypes, classic inflammatory  IC and non-ulcerative IC. Patients characteristically present with urinary urgency,  frequency, nocturia and pain related to bladder filling. The  pain is located in the lower urinary tract—involving the  suprapubic and pelvic area, perineum, vagina and urethra. In  the early stages, IC presents with cycles of flares and remission.  Flares are triggered by stressors, be it emotional, physical  or hormonal fluctuations to name a few. These symptoms  gradually deteriorate over time as the disease progresses.  Diagnosis is usually one of exclusion, and the NIDDK  inclusion and exclusion criteria can be helpful in making a  clinical diagnosis of IC (outlined in  Table 1 ) (2) though these  were developed initially to permit a unified research framework.   The aetiology of IC is still uncertain. In 1996, Parsons  postulated that the pathophysiology of the disease involves  an epithelial dysfunction of the lower urinary tract (3).  He further described in 2003 that this dysfunction was  primarily located in the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) layers  of the bladder urothelium. The GAG layer is made up of  hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulphate, heparin sulphate  and keratin sulphate (4). In healthy patients, the GAG layer  acts as a barrier to protect the bladder submucosa from  urinary solutes. In IC, the GAG layer is damaged and made  permeable, allowing an influx of urinary solutes, particularly  potassium into the submucosa. This influx of potassium  causes a cascade of tissue inflammation, degranulation of  mast cells, and depolarisation of the sensory nerves, resulting  in injury to tissue and bladder pain.  It is postulated that potassium is the urinary metabolite  primarily responsible for generating bladder symptoms  when the GAG layer is dysfunctional.

The aetiology of the disease remains uncertain, but it is postulated that there  is an initial infective insult which damages the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer of the bladder urothelium.  This defect allows an influx of ions, particularly potassium, which initiates an inflammatory reaction in the  bladder wall, which incites the symptoms described above. Treatment initially involves behavioural and oral  medication, with second line being intravesical instillation therapy. Treatment strategies focus on restoring  lower urinary tract epithelial function, inhibiting neural activation, controlling allergies and relieving  symptoms. In this review, current intravesical therapy will be discussed, as well as what lies on the horizon  for intravesical therapy in IC.

Table 1  NIDDK IC Criteria Inclusion criteria Hunner’s Ulcer (automatic inclusion) Pain on bladder filling relieved by emptying Pain (suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal or perineal) Glomerulations on endoscopy Decreased bladder compliance on cystometrogram 2 positive factors necessary for inclusion Exclusion criteria &lt;18 years old Benign or malignant bladder tumours Radiation cystitis Tuberculous cystitis Bacterial cystitis Vaginitis Cyclophosphamide cystitis Symptomatic urethral diverticulum Uterine, cervical, vaginal or urethral Ca Active herpes Bladder or lower ureteral calculi Waking frequency &lt;5 times in 12 hours Nocturia &lt;2 times Symptoms relieved by antibiotics, urinary antiseptics, urinary  analgesia Duration &lt;12 months Involuntary bladder contractions (urodynamics) Capacity &gt;400 mL, absence of sensory urgency potassium required to depolarise nerves and muscles  sits around 8–10 mEq/L, which is significantly lower  than the K+ level in urine ~30–120 mEq/L. Thus, it is  understandable that in IC, diffusion initiates a big cascade of  depolarisation, generating symptoms of urgency, frequency,  pain and incontinence (5). Treatment strategies focus on: (I)   Restoring lower urinary tract epithelial function; (II)   Inhibiting neural activation; (III)   Controlling allergies; (IV)   Relieving symptoms. Current therapy involves behavioural modification, oral  medical therapy, intravesical therapy and surgery. First  line therapy involves oral medication and behavioural  modification (e.g., pelvic floor exercises, controlled  fluid intake and bladder training). Oral medical therapy  encompasses analgesics (i.e., amitriptyline, gabapentin),  antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), antihistamines,  immunosuppressants and oral pentosan polysulfate. Second  line therapy, involves the trial of intravesical therapy. In this review, we will be focussing on current  intravesical therapy and what lies on the horizon for IC.  Intravesical instillation has the advantage of providing  high concentrations of therapy locally in the bladder,  whilst avoiding systemic side effects associated with oral  medications. Unfortunately, very few large double-blinded  randomised controlled studies exist in this field. This is  largely due to difficulty double-blinding participants and  the lack of an objective measure of response to treatment— success of a treatment is subjective to a patient’s personal  assessment. This is in addition to the exacerbating and  remitting nature of the disease. Challenges to intravesical therapy include: (I)   Short duration of action;  (II)   Lack of permeability of the bladder epithelium; (III)   Lack of bladder uptake of drugs.  Intravesical agents studied to date Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) IC is thought to be an autoimmune condition, with reports  of autoantibodies being found in IC bladders and IC  histopathology displaying similarities to other autoimmune  condition. Patients with IC have been found to have 5 times  the level of interleukin 6 productions compared to controls (6).    This forms the basis behind BCG therapy. The exact  mechanism of BCG therapy is not yet known. Theoretically  it is believed to cause a down regulation of the interleukin-6  (IL-6) response which is upregulated in IC (7). This theory  is challenged by the other studies reporting intravesical  BCG increasing IL-6 in classic IC and worsening the  inflammatory response (8).  Numerous studies have been performed, with the last  randomised controlled study of 265 participants finding no  difference between intravesical BCG therapy and placebo (9).    Patients were randomised into 6 weekly instillations of  placebo (50 mL normal saline) or BCG (1 mL BCG in  49 mL saline) and followed for 34 weeks.

All rights reserved. Vanilloids The bladder pain experienced in IC is believed to be  mediated by afferent C-fibre sensory neurons—with 50%  of bladder afferents being unmyelinated sensory C fibres.  These C-fibres may also have a mechanosensitive role in  contributing to the urinary urgency and frequency seen  in IC. In IC, these fibres are abnormally stimulated due  to urothelium injury. The potential of vanilloids (i.e.,  resiniferatoxin, capsaicin) was first suggested by in-vitro  data which demonstrated C-fibres entering a refractory state  and becoming desensitised after vanilloid stimulation (16).  This desensitisation in pain fibres was hoped to translate  into clinical management of IC.  Research has been performed into vanilloid receptor  agonists. The theory is that the use of these agents will  desensitise C-fibres and therefore provide symptomatic pain  relief. Currently trials in these two agents have been unfruitful. Resiniferatoxin Resiniferatoxin is a potent analogue of Capsaicin, which has  been found in animal models to have improved efficacy to  pain fibre receptors (17). In 2005, Payne  et al.  randomly allocated 163 participants  to receive one dose of intravesical 50 mL resiniferatoxin (at  differing doses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 mcg) or a placebo (17).  Twelve weeks post intravesical instillation patients were  evaluated using the Global Response Assessment (GRA).  At the conclusion of the study, patients who underwent  resiniferatoxin treatment demonstrated no improvement  in symptoms. Additionally, significant post-instillation pain  was noted with resiniferatoxin which corresponded to the  dose given. This suggested that vanilloids may not be an  appropriate treatment. Payne  et al. ’s study is the largest resiniferatoxin study to  date. A 2013 meta-analysis performed by Guo  et al.  (16),  reviewed six other studies with smaller cohorts between  18–54 participants. These studies found no improvement  in urinary frequency, nocturia, incontinence or bladder  capacity but bladder pain was found to be reduced. Botulinum toxin A Botulinumtoxin is a potent neurotoxin produced from  clostridium botulinum. It acts by cleaving the 25-kDa  synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25 protein) in the  presynaptic terminal (18). This prevents neurotransmission  at the presynaptic membrane, which disables neural  transmission from nerve fibres to bladder urothelium,  preventing muscle contraction. Its muscle relaxant  properties are believed to provide symptomatic relief  in IC, but evidence suggests that it may carry analgesic  properties as well. In 2009, the FDA introduced new  drug names for botulinum toxin type A to reflect the  differences in potencies. Whilst all inherently botulinum  toxin A—onabotulinumtoxin A, abobotulinumtoxinA and  rimabotulinumtoxin B all have different potencies and  therefore, different indications for use. The current evidence is non-conclusive. There is also  no evidence to suggest that this therapy is sustainable.  Efficacy is reduced with repeated injections raising  concerns for long term safety and resistance with repeated  administration. In 2014, Manning  et al.  published a randomised, double  blind study involving 54 women with severe IC (19).    Participants were randomly allocated to either hydrodistension  + intravesical instillation of Abobotulinum A (AboBTXA) or  hydrodistension + intravesical instillation of normal saline.  Outcomes were reviewed at 3 months via the O’Leary- Sant questionnaire. Results were confounded by 12 patients  suffering from urinary tract infections, and these patients  were not included in the final results. At the conclusion of the  study, five AboBTXA participants showed &gt;50% improvement  compared to two placebo participants. The study concluded  Abobotulinumtoxin A showed no overall improvement for  patients suffering from severe refractory IC, but significant  benefit was noted in a small number of patients.  Conversely, a larger 2015 retrospective study by Gao  et al.     demonstrated positive outcomes post Botulinumtoxin A  instillation (18). A total of 124 women over a 10-year period  [2003–2013] were retrospectively reviewed; 66 women  were treated with 100 U of Botulinumtoxin A whilst 58  underwent bladder hydrodistension + sodium hyaluronate  instillation. Again, participants were evaluated with the  O’Leary-Sant or VAS score. At 1 week, 92.2% efficacy was  noted after a single dose, though efficacy fell to 75% at    3 months. At 12 months, after a single dose, symptoms had  returned to baseline, demonstrating no sustainability of this  treatment but short term relief was achievable. The efficacy  for Botulinumtoxin A was similar to the hyaluronate used  as a control, demonstrating that it could be a potential safe  and therapeutic alternative treatment for IC. Both studies have their different merits, but to establish  whether Botulinumtoxin A is of use in IC, a larger  randomised controlled double blind trial is required. </p>

Lidocaine Lidocaine (xylocaine or lignocaine) is a common topical  anaesthetic which currently has level B evidence for IC  (AUA guidelines). It has shown promise as a short-acting  analgesic in IC, with its effects rarely lasting past two weeks.  Lidocaine is believed to anaesthetise the bladder afferent  nerves which cause the lower urinary tract pain associated  with IC. It is usually alkalinised to counter the acidic nature  of the urine. Once instilled, the solution is buffered by  surrounding tissue and penetrates the bladder lining by  converting into a lipid-soluble base form. One of the largest multi-centre, double blind, placebo- controlled studies was performed by Nickel  et al.  in 2008 (20).    A total of 102 patients were randomised to receive 10 mL    of 200 mg of alkalinised lidocaine (AL) or saline for    5 consecutive days. Outcomes were measured using the  GRA scale, with patients being followed up to 29 days    post-instillation. Thirty percent of experimental patients  noted immediate improvement post-lidocaine course  compared to 9.6% in the control group, but efficacy  dropped off back to baseline by day 10. Lidocaine has been  increasingly used in combination with other intravesical  therapies due to its immediate efficacy, in particular heparin  which is discussed later in this chapter . GAG layer reconstruction  In recent years, GAG layer replenishment (21) has come to  the forefront of IC management. First identified in 1975 by  Parsons  et al. , the GAG layer is a mucus layer over the bladder  urothelium that acts as a barrier against bacteria (22). It is  made up predominantly of HA, chondroitin sulfate, heparin  sulfate and keratin sulfate. Therefore, the theory behind GAG  replenishment therapy is to reconstruct this layer by instilling  components of the GAG layer into the bladder. HA  HA is a glycoprotein that is an important component of the  GAG layer. It alleviates the inflammatory process by both  inhibiting leukocyte migration/aggregation and binding to  lymphocytes and endothelial cells, blocking the ICAM-1  receptors (23). Additionally, it appears to inhibit mast cell  degranulation, the activation of which is a crucial step in the  natural history of IC (24). Intravesical instillation of HA has shown some promise  in small cohort trials, but no multi-centre, double blinded  controlled study has shown any statistically significant  benefit. In 2013, Lai  et al.  conducted a prospective  randomised study comparing different HA treatment  regime (25). Sixty patients were assigned to receive 4 weekly    instillations, followed by 5 monthly instillations    (HA-9 group) or 12 instillations fortnightly (HA-12 group).  Both groups showed improvement in O’Leary Sant scores,  VAS score and quality of life. No statistically significant  difference between regimes was noted though the data  below demonstrates a trend to improvement occurred in all  parameters with increasing numbers of instillations. Due to the multifactorial aetiology of IC, patients are  being increasingly treated with combined intravesical therapy  to potentiate the therapeutic benefit of treatment courses.  Lv  et al.  compared the effectiveness of combined HA with  AL to two control groups of monotherapy (26). Forty-five  women were randomised, with the combined HA + AL group  demonstrating significant improvement at week 2 which  continued onto trial completion at 48 weeks. Monotherapy  AL showed improvement at 2 weeks, but therapeutic benefit  ceased at week 24, whilst monotherapy HA had a later onset  at 4 weeks but remained beneficial until study completion. Chondroitin sulfate Chondroitin sulfate has been identified as a key component  in the human bladder GAG layer. Theoretically, instilling  chondroitin, would be expected to be more beneficial than  HA when used to regenerate the GAG layer due to the  larger role it plays.  A course involves 20 mL of 2.0% sodium chondroitin  sulfate instilled into the bladder weekly for 6–8 weeks. A 2009 open study by Nickel  et al.  treated 53 patients  with sodium chondroitin weekly for 6 weeks, then monthly  for 4 months—a total of 10 treatments (27). Outcomes were  compared to baseline function and 60.4% of patients noted  improvement in pain, urgency and frequency at the 24-week  mark, demonstrating potential efficacy for this treatment.  Nickel  et al.  subsequently went on to review the efficacy  of sodium chondroitin in a randomised, double blind  cohort, by comparing outcomes to an inactive normal  saline control group (28). Patients were treated with weekly  instillations for 6 weeks, then followed up for a further    6 weeks. An improvement was noted in 22.6% of control  patients  vs.  39.4% in the chondroitin group. A second randomised control study was then performed  by Nickel  et al.  in 2012 with a larger cohort of 98 women (29).    They were randomised to receive sodium chondroitin  therapy or an inactive control for 8 weeks. Thirty-eight  percent of the active group noted improvement compared  </p>
