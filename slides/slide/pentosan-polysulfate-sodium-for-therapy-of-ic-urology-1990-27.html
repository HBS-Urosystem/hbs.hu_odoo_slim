This  instrument  also  allowed  the  patient  to  evaluate  the  changes,  if  any,  they  perceived  in  urgency  and  pain  using  the  same  definitions  for  overall  im-  provement.  An  investigator's  evaluation  form  for  overall  improvement  was  eompleted  by  the  investiga-  tor  after  examining  the  patient  and  reviewing  the  data  provided  in  voiding  profiles  and  the  pain  and  urgency  scales  while  maintaining  the  double-blind.  The  scale  used  by  the  investigator  contained  categories  of  &quot;worse,&quot;  &quot;no  change,&quot;  &quot;fair,  ....  good,&quot;  &quot;very  good,&quot;  and  &quot;exeellent.&quot;  A  volume-voiding  profile  measuring  the  time  and  quantity  of  all  voids  during  waking  hours  as  well  as  the  number  of  voids  during  sleeping  hours  over  three  consecutive  days  was  eom-  pleted  by  the  patient  before  treatment,  and  at  the  end  of  the  first,  second,  and  third  months  of  treatment.  This  provided  information  concern-  ing  ehanges  in  average  voided  volume,  fie-  queney,  and  noeturia  during  the  three-month  treatment  period.  Pain  and  urgeney  seales  were  included  on  one  sheet  and  were  eompleted  before  start  of  treat-  ment  and  at  the  end  of  one,  two,  and  three  months  of  treatment.  Both  scales  allowed  the  patient  to  express  the  degree  of  pain  and  urgency  onasealeof0toS:  0  =  none,  I  --  mild,  3  =  moderate,  and  5  =  severe.  Routine  laboratory  examinations  were  eon-  dueted  before  treatment  and  at  the  end  of  the  three-month  treatment  period.  This  ineluded  urinalysis,  complete  blood  eounts,  blood  chemistries  including  prothrombin  time  and  partial  thromboplastin  time,  and  liver  function  tests.  Adverse  reaction  report  forms  provided  space  for  recording  the  type  of  reaction,  treatment,  outcome,  comment,  and  relation  to  treatment  as  possible,  probable,  not  likely,  or  other  cause.  Reports  of  side  effects  were  volunteered.  This  was  considered  appropriate  for  these  patients  because  interstitial  cystitis  patients  are  known  to  be  exquisitely  aware  of  any  changes  in  their  condition  and  prone  to  discuss  them  with  their  physicians.  At  the  end  of  the  three-month  double-blind  period,-the  patients  were  offered  the  opportu-  nity  to  continue  taking  PPS  as  long  as  they  con-  tinued  to  experience  relief  of  their  symptoms,  or  to  start  taking  PPS  if  they  had  been  assigned  to  the  placebo  group.  Variables  for  the  determina-  tion  of  PPS  efficacy  in  order  of  relevancy  were  the  patient's  assessment  of  overall  improve-  ment,  the  investigator's  assessment  of  overall  improvement,  the  changes  in  pain  and  urgency,  the  change  in  nocturia,  and  the  change  in  fre-  quency  and  average  voided  volume.  In  each  ease  the  change  from  the  baseline  values  at  the  end  of  the  double-blind  period  was  used  as  the  basis  for  determining  the  efficacy  of  Elmiron.  Statistical  Treatment  of  Data  The  treatment  groups  were  compared  both  within  each  study  center  and  across  all  study  centers,  with  respect  to  the  response  variables  recorded  at  the  pretreatment  visit.  For  the  quantitative  variables  such  as  age,  bladder  ca-  pacity,  pain,  urgency,  frequency  of  urination,  and  total  urine  volume,  a  t-test  was  used.  The  analysis  of  the  qualitative  variables  such  as  sex,  race,  and  severity  of  variables  associated  with  the  cystoscopie  evaluation  were  analyzed  with  a  ehi-square  contingency  table  analysis.  Addi-  tionally,  for  those  response  variables  scored  with  a  severity  rating,  a  Mantel-Haenszel  test  was  used  to  compare  the  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  a  linear  association  between  severity  and  response  rate.  The  treatment  groups  were  compared  for  changes  in  the  response  variables  of  pain,  urgency,  frequency  of  urination,  and  the  total  urine  volume,  both  within  each  study  center  and  across  all  study  centers.  The  analysis  of  these  changes  from  baseline  variables  was  with  an  analysis  of  variance,  using  a  general  ]inear  models  procedure.  For  each  treatment  group,  the  significance  of  the  mean  change  was  deter-  mined  with  a  t-test.  With  respect  to  the  pain  and  urgency  scales,  treatment  was  considered  to  be  successful  if  there  was  a  I-point  or  greater  reduction  on  the  severity  scale  or  unsuccessful  if  there  was  less  th  an  a  1-point  reduction  on  the  severity  scale.  A  decrease  of  3  or  more  per  day  in  frequency  of  urination,  and  an  increase  in  urine  volume  of  20  mL  or  more  per  void  were  also  used  as  indi-  cations  of  improvement.  For  each  of  these  crite-  ria,  treatment  groups  were  compared  using  Fisher's  exact  test  within  each  study  center,  and  the  ManteI-Haenszel  test  was  used  to  compare  treatment  groups  after  collapsing  data  across  study  centers.  For  the  investigator  and  patient  evaluations  made  at  the  completion  of  the  three-month  double-blind  phase,  treatment  group  compari-  sons  were  made  with  ehi-square  contingency  554  UROLOGY  /  JUNE  1990  /  VOLUME  XXXV,  NUMBE[q  6  </p>

In  addition,  the  PPS-treated  patients  with  verified  disease  were  shown  to  have  a  statistically  significant  in-  crease  in  bladder  eapacity  measured  under  anesthesia,  as  well  as  a  statistically  significant  improved  cystoscopie  appearanee  of  the  blad-  der.  Because  of  the  existing  evidence  indicating  that  PPS  may  have  efficacy  in  this  disorder,  the  current  study  was  undertaken  with  a  greater  degree  of  control  and  a  larger  population  of  pa-  tients  with  well:defined  disease.  Material  and  Methods  This  study  was  conducted  in  a  double-blind  manner,  and  a  placebo  concurrent  control  group  was  used  as  a  comparison  for  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  PPS.  The  three-month  double-  blind  period  with  the  placebo  control  made  it  possible  to  study  the  true  extent  to  which  PPS  modulated  the  symptoms  of  disease  in  these  pa-  tients.  The  study  was  multieentered  with  five  participating  centers.  Patients  were  categorized  in  terms  of  the  severity  of  their  disease.  Patients  with  a  moder-  ate  degree  of  disease  were  defined  as  having  an  anesthetic  bladder  capacity  over  400  mL,  18  or  fewer  voids  per  day,  and  an  average  voided  vol-  ume  of  75  mL  or  more.  Patients  were  consid-  ered  to  have  a  severe  degree  of  disease  if  they  had  a  bladder  capacity  under  anesthesia  of  less  than  400  mL,  or  more  than  18  voids  per  day,  or  an  average  voided  volume  of  less  than  75  mL.  A  patient  with  any  one  of  these  three  criteria  was  included  in  the  severe  group.  Anesthetic  blad-  der  capacity  was  measured  under  80  em  of  wa-  ter  pressure  held  for  one  minute  in  all  patients  under  general  or  spinal  anesthesia.  To.  be  included  in  the  study,  all  patients  had  to  have  the  following  examination  require-  ments  and  symtom  complex:  Urgency  expressed  as  &quot;moderate&quot;  on  a  5-point  analog  scale  Frequeney  of  at  least  10  voids  per  day  Nocturia  of  at  least  2  voids  per  night  Pain  as  recorded  on  a  5-point  analog  scale  Continuous  duration  of  symptoms  of  at  least  one  year  Failed  previous  conventional  therapy  such  as  chlorpactin,  hydrodilatation,  or  DMSO  Average  voided  volume  of  200  mL  or  less  measured  over  a  three-day  period  Negative  urine  culture  and  cytology  Cystoseopic  examination  under  anesthesia  (80  cm  of  water  and  1  minut  e  distention)  showing  pe-  teehial  hemorrhages  or  ulcers  with  gross  blood  in  the  fluid  return  and  a  bladder  capacity  of  800  mL  or  less  Patients  were  excluded  from  participation  in  the  study  for  any  of  these  conditions:  Age  less  than  eighteen  years  Pregnancy  Premenopausal  and  not  practieing  effective  means  of  birth  control  Evidenee  of  active  bleeding  peptic  ulcer  disease  Bleeding  diathesis  Anticoagulant  therapy  Chronic  use  of  narcotics  Known  allergy  to  pentosan  polysulfate  sodium  Lack  of  availability  for  the  duration  of  the  study  or  inability  to  follow  instructions  Use  of  artificial  sweeteners  Lactating  mothers  Signs  of:  recurrent  bacteriuria  obvious  neurologic  impairment  history  of  pelvic  irradiation  previous  treatment  with  known  bladder  irritants  bladder  careinoma  urinary  tuberculosis  shistosomiasis  Treatment  with  Elmiron  within  six  weeks  of  study  Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  PPS  or  placebo  group  in  accordance  with  a  computer-  generated  random  code  providing  two  parallel  groups  of  patients  for  comparison.  All  investi-  gators  were  blinded  during  the  study  with  the  code  established  and  maintained  by  a  separate  center.  The  dose  of  PPS  was  300  mg  daily  given  orally  in  divided  doses  of  100  mg  three  times  a  day  one  hour  before  meals  or  two  hours  after  meals.  Identically-appearing  placebo  capsules  were  given  in  the  same  manner.  All  patients  were  seen  at  zero  time  before  start  of  treatment  for  evaluation  of  baseline  symptoms  and  labo-  ratory  values  and  at  twelve  weeks  after  start  of  treatment  for  measurement  of  these  same  varia-  bles.  The  primary  instrument  used  for  evaluation  was  a  follow-up  questionnaire  completed  by  the  patient  at  the  end  of  the  double-blind  treatment  period.  The  patients  were  asked  if  they  felt  im-  proved  overall  since  the  start  of  treatment,  and  UROLOGY  /  JUNE  1990  /  VOLUME  XXXV,  NUMBER  6  553  </p>

For  those  response  variables  recorded  on  a  severity  scale,  the  treatment  groups  were  compared  us-  ing  a  Mantel-Haenszel  test  with  respect  to  lin-  ear  association.  In  addition,  a  bloeked  Wilcoxon  test  was  used  to  compare  the  treat-  ment  groups  after  adjustment  for  study  center  dffferenees.  All  adverse  experiences  were  recorded  and  their  frequency  determined  for  each  treatment  group.  For  each  type  of  adverse  experience,  the  treatment  groups  were  compared  with  respeet  to  the  percent  of  patients  experiencing  the  ad-  verse  effect,  using  Fisher's  exact  test.  All  computations  were  performed  using  the  Statistical  Analysis  System  (SAS).  Statistical  sig-  nificance  was  deelared  if  the  p-value  was  equal  to  or  less  than  0.05.  Results  There  were  110  patients  with  documented  interstitial  cystitis  with  a  duration  of  one  year  or  more  enrolled  in  the  study.  Of  these,  56  pa-  tients  were  treated  with  placebo,  and  54  were  treated  with  PPS.  There  were  no  significant  dif-  ferences  between  the  treatment  groups  at  the  beginning  of  the  study  in  terms  of  age,  sex  dis-  tribution,  race,  cystoscopie  findings,  duration  of  disease,  bladder  capacity,  or  severity  of  dis-  ease.  These  data  are  summarized  in  Table  I.  Twelve  patients,  3  treated  with  PPS  and  9  treated  with  placebo,  failed  to  complete  the  three  month  study.  Of  these  12,  8  were  in  the  group  of  patients  classified  as  having  severe  dis-  ease,  1  (3  %  )  receiving  PPS  and  7  (21%  )  receiv-  ing  placebo.  Most  of  these  patients  were  lost  to  follow-up,  and  it  is  likely  that  tack  of  efficacy  was  responsible  for  the  patients  dropping  out.  The  differenee  in  the  drop-out  rate  between  the  treatment  groups  in  these  patients  with  severe  disease  was  statistically  signifieant  (p  =  0.05).  At  the  end  of  the  three-month  treatment  pe-  riod,  28  percent  of  the  PPS  patients  versus  18  percent  of  the  placebo  patients  evaluated  them-  selves  as  more  than  slightly  improved  relative  to  their  condition  at  the  beginning  of  the  study  on  the  5-point  scale  from  &quot;no  change'&quot;  to  &quot;complete  cure&quot;  (p  =  0.04).  In  terms  of  reduced  pain,  27  percent  of  the  PPS  patients  evaluated  themselves  as  improved  compared  with  14  percent  of  the  placebo  pa-  tients  (p  =  0.08).  This  was  confirmed  by  the  pain  scale  data  where  46  pereent  of  the  PPS  pa-  tients  and  29  pereent  of  the  placebo  patients  re-  corded  a  decrease  in  pain  of  1  or  more  (p  =  0.07).  The  mean  reduction  in  pain  from  base-  line  as  measured  by  the  pain  scale  was  0.5  for  the  PPS-treated  patients  eompared  with  0.2  for  the  plaeebo  patients  at  three  months.  This  dif-  ference  between  the  treatment  groups  was  not  statistically  significant,  but  the  dffferenee  from  baseline  was  signifieantty  different  from  zero  (p  =  0.05)  for  the  PPS-treated  group  but  not  for  the  placebo-treated  group.  The  latter  held  true  with  p  =  0.01  to  0.05  for  the  end  of  months  1  and  2  as  well.  At  the  three-month  self-evaluation,  22  per-  cent  of  the  PPS  patients  and  11  percent  of  the  placebo  patients  expressed  an  improvement  in  pressure  to  urinate  (p  =  0.08).  This  was  not  confirmed  by  the  urgency  scale  data  which  re-  vealed  a  slight  margin  of  39  percent  to  46  per-  cent  in  favor  of  plaeebo.  By  the  investigator's  evaluation  of  overall  improvement,  26  percent  of  the  PPS-treated  patients  and  11  percent  of  the  placebo  patients  had  an  improvement  of  at  least  good  or  better  on  the  6-point  scale  from  &quot;worse&quot;  to  &quot;excellent&quot;  (p  =  0.03).  There  was  a  mean  increase  in  volume  per  void  of  9.8  ce  for  the  PPS-treated  patients,  and  7.6  ee  per  void  for  placebo  patients.  Among  the  PPS  patients,  30  percent  had  an  increase  of  20  ce  or  more  eompared  with  20  percent  of  the  placebo  patients.

                                            <p>6. Patients  are  not  at  all  alike  in  the  manner  in  which  they  evaluate  and  report  individual  symptoms.  Some  patients  report  a  decrease  in  urgency,  or  perhaps  pain,  when  the  number  of  days  that  these  symptoms  are  present  is  signifi-  cantly  reduced,  while  other  patients  with  a  sim-  ilar  reduction  will  not  report  a  decrease  because  the  urgency  or  pain  is  still  severe  on  the  days  that  either  one  is  present.  Frequency  and  urine  volume  also  can  be  misleading  symptoms.  Some  patients  restrict  fluid  intake  during  particularly  painful  periods  and  increase  fluid  intake  when  pain  is  ameliorated.  In  these  patients,  when  treatment  produces  a  decrease  in  pain,  fre-  quency  may  increase  while  urine  volume  per  void  may  remain  the  same  or  show  a  small  in-  crease,  or  frequency  may  remain  the  same  with  an  increase  in  volume  per  void.  The  symptom  complex  varies  among  patients  in  terms  of  which  of  the  symptoms  is  most  prominent  and/or  is  perceived  as  most  bother-  some  or  disabling.  While  any  given  treatment  may  provide  some  relief  for  most  or  all  of  a  pa-  tient's  symptoms,  it  may  not  provide  enough  re-  lief  of  the  particular  symptom  or  symptoms  that  the  patient  perceives  as  most  important.  Guid-  ing  the  patient  to  think  in  terms  of  overall  relief,  helps  to  overcome  the  dilution  that  can  result  from  too  sharp  a  focus  on  individual  symptoms.  For  these  reasons  emphasis  in  this  study  was  placed  on  overall  improvement  as  expressed  by  the  patient  and  investigator,  while  the  changes  in  specific  symptomatology  were  considered  as  supportive  data.  In  this  respect,  the  results  of  this  study  confirm  the  observations  made  in  previous  studies  of  PPS  for  the  treatment  on  in-  terstitial  cystitis.  On  the  self  evaluation  by  the  patient,  28  percent  of  the  patients  who  received  PPS  felt  that  they  experienced  significant  over-  all  improvement  in  their  disease  compared  with  their  condition  at  the  beginning  of  treatment.  This  differed  significantly  (p  =  0.04)  from  the  placebo-treated  patients,  13  percent  of  whom  reported  a  similar  result.  The  investigators'  overall  evaluation  at  the  end  of  the  double-  blind  period  agreed  with  the  patients'  self-eval-  uation  with  26  percent  of  the  PPS  patients  eval-  uated  as  significantly  improved  compared  with  11  percent  of  the  placebo  patients.  This  dif-  ference  was  significant  at  the  0.03  level.  In  the  self-evaluation  of  overall  improvement,  pa-  tients  who  reported  only  slight  improvement  on  the  1  e.  ~  1  ,~:,,  1,  ~-  ,,  ,~  1  -  ,,  some  ot  no  change,  Sllgllt,  mocterate,  &quot;great,&quot;  or  &quot;complete&quot;  were  not  included  in  the  group  considered  to  have  been  significantly  im-  proved.  In  the  evaluation  by  the  investigator,  overall  improvement  that  was  rated  as  &quot;fair&quot;  on  the  scale  of  &quot;worse,&quot;  &quot;no  change,&quot;  &quot;fair,&quot;  &quot;good,&quot;  &quot;very  good,&quot;  or  &quot;excellent&quot;  was  not  in-  eluded  in  the  group  of  patients  considered  to  have  had  significant  overall  improvement.  Improvement  in  pain  approached  signifi-  cance  on  both  the  pain  scale  and  in  terms  of  the  patient's  perception  of  pain  improvement  as  ex-  pressed  on  the  follow-up  questionnaire  (p  =  0.07  and  0.08,  respectively),  Also  at  each  of  the  periods  of  measurement  from  the  end  of  one  month  to  the  end  of  treatment,  the  decrease  in  pain  as  measured  on  the  pain  scale  was  signifi-  cantly  different  from  0  (p  =  0.01  to  0.05)  for  the  PPS-treated  group  but  not  for  the  placebo  group,  although  the  degree  of  change  between  the  groups  was  not  significant.  Pain  as  a  symp-  tom  may  improve  first,  representing  a  decrease  in  inflammatory  response.  On  the  other  hand,  refunctionalization  of  the  bladder  appears  to  be  a  much  slower  response.  The  results  from  the  urgency  scale  and  the  follow-up  questionnaire  were  disparate.  On  the  urgency  scale,  the  difference  between  the  groups  was  slightly  in  favor  of  placebo  (46  %  to  39  %)  but  not  statistically  significant.  On  the  follow-up  questionnaire  where  the  question  was  framed  in  terms  of  pressure-to-urinate  rather  than  urgency,  the  difference  between  the  groups  in  favor  of  PPS  (22%  to  11%)  ap-  proached  significance  at  0.08.  The  reason  for  the  disparity  is  unknown,  except  that  patients  may  interpret  the  terms  differently.  The  data  relating  to  the  changes  in  voided  volume  were  in  favor  of  the  PPS-treated  group  although  not  significantly  different  from  pla-  cebo.  There  was  a  mean  increase  of  9.8  ec  in  volume  per  void,  a  mean  increase  of  60  cc  in  total  daily  volume,  and  an  increase  of  20  cc  or  more  in  volume:  per  void  by  30  percent  of  the  patients  who  received  PPS.  The  comparable  figures  for  the  patients  who  received  placebo  were  7.6  co,  mean  decrease  of  20  ee,  and  20  per-  cent,  respectively.  The  changes  in  frequency  noted  in  this  study  did  not  differ  significantly  between  the  groups  in  terms  of  daytime  voids  where  there  was  a  re-  duction  of  1  void  per  day  for  both  groups,  for  noeturia  where  tI~ere  was  a  reduction  of  0.8  voids  for  PPS  and  0.5  voids  for  placebo,  and  for  percent  of  patients  having  a  reduction  of  3  or  ~nore  voids  )er  day  with  32  percent  for  PPS  and  34  percent  for  placebo.

A  total  o]  110  patients  were  enrolled  and  treated]or  three  months.  In  this  study,  overall  improvement  o]  greater  than  25  percent  was  reported  by  28  percent  o]  the  PPS-treated  patients  and  by  13  percent  of-  the  placebo-treated  patients  (p  =  O.  03).  The  investigators&quot;  overall  evaluation  provided  similar  results,  26  percent  vs  1I  percent  in  ]avor  o]  PPS  (p  =  O.  04).  Improvement  in  pain  and  pressure  to  urinate  also  favored  PPS  over  placebo  and  approached  statistical  significance  (p  =  0,07  and  O.  08).  The  incidence  o]  adverse  reactions  was  6  percent  in  the  PPS-treated  group  and  13  percent  in  the  placebo-treated  group.  All  adverse  reactions  were  minor,  and  treatment  was  discontinued  by  I  patient  in  the  PPS  group  and  2  in  the  placebo  group.  In  this  study,  PPS  was  ]ound  to  be  significantly  more  e]]ective  than,  and  equally  as  safe  as,  placebo.  Interstitial  cystitis  is  a  syndrome  characterized  by  the  symptoms  of  urinary  urgency,  urinary  frequency,  nocturia,  and  lower  abdominal  and  perineal  pain  and/or  discomfort.  It  occurs  in  the  absence  of  infection  or  other  known  patho-  logic  processes  such  as  carcinoma  in  situ,  radia-  tion,  or  chemical  cystitis.  Although  its  etiology  has  not  been  definitely  established,  1  it  has  been  postulated  that  interstitial  cystitis  is  caused  by  a  dysfunctional  epithelium  which  becomes  per-  meable  and  allows  the  leak  of  urinary  solutes  across  the  transitional  cells.  2  In  both  animals  and  humans,  it  has  been  shown  that  the  princi-  pal  barrier  to  permeability  is  the  surface  glycosaminoglycans.  3-v  A  permeable  bladder  epithelium  can  result  in  diffusion  of  irritating  components  from  normal  urine  through  to  the  bladder  wall  to  set  up  a  chronic  inflammatory  condition  initiating  the  symptoms  of  pain,  urgency,  and  frequency2  Based  on  the  possibil-  ity  that  there  is  a  deficiency-  of  the  surface  gly-  cosaminoglycans  in  patients  with  interstitial  cystitis,  patients  were  treated  with  a  synthetic  sulfated  polysaccharide,  pentosan  polysulfate  sodium  (PPS),  in  an  attempt  to  ameliorate  their  symptoms.  This  hypothesis  has  been  tested  in  three  published  clinical  studies  using  PPS  (Elmiron).  In  two  studies,  one  double-blind,  placebo-con-  trolled,  7  and  one  open-eontrolled,  8  PPS  was  shown  to  be  effective  in  relieving  the  sympto-  matology  of  interstitial  cystitis  in  a  significant  number  of  patients.  In  a  third  study,  °  the  authors  concluded  that  there  were  no  signifi-  cant  differences  between  the  PPS  and  placebo-  treated  groups.  However,  in  the  group  of  552  UROLOGY  /  JUNE  1990  /  VOLUME  XXXV,  NUMBEIq  6  </p>

These  dif-  ferences  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  efficacy  data  as  measured  by  these  parameters  in  this  study  are  summarized  in  Table  II.  The  changes  from  baseline  at  the  endpoint  in  the  re-  maining  parameters  studied  were  not  different  between  treatments.  These  were  voids  per  day  (-  1  for  both  treatments),  percent  of  patients  having  3  less  voids  per  day  (32  %  PPS,  24  %  pla-  cebo),  and  nocturia  (  -  0.8  PPS,  -  0.5  placebo).  The  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  in  this  study  was  low  in  both  treatment  groups.  Among  the  PPS-treated  patients,  3  (6%)  re-  ported  a  total  of  6  adverse  reactions,  and  7  (13  %  )  placebo  patients  reported  a  total  of  8  ad-  verse  reactions.  The  observed  reactions  were  not  different  from  reactions  that  might  be  ob-  served  in  any  random  population  over  a  three-  month  period  and  were  not  serious.  Only  1  PPS  and  2  placebo  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  adverse  reactions.  Only  diarrhea  was  ob-  served  in  more  than  1  patient.  These  data  are  summarized  in  Table  III.  There  were  no  differences  between  the  treat-  ment  groups  in  terms  of  clinically  significant  changes  in  any  of  the  laboratory  data.  One  pa-  tient  in  the  PPS-treated  group  had  SGOT  and  SGPT  values  of  118  and  133  at  three  months  compared  with  56  and  115  at  baseline,  respec-  tively,  at  each  time.  There  were  no  other  re-  markable  changes.  Of  the  patients  who  completed  the  three-  month  double-blind  period,  44  percent  were  continuing  therapy  with  PPS  one  and  a  half  years  after  the  start  of  the  study.

Comment  The  primary  measurement  used  to  determine  effectiveness  of  PPS  was  the  patient  evaluation  of  overall  improvement.  The  investigator's  assessment  of  overall  improvement  was  also  a  measure  of  efficacy,  second  only  to  the  patient's  self-evaluation.  The  measure  of  overall  improvement  was  considered  to  be  the  most  appropriate  measure  of  treatment  efficacy  because  the  individual  symptoms  of  interstitial  cystitis  frequency,  urgency,  pain,  and  nocturia--vary  widely  within  and  among  patients  in  terms  of  occur-  rence,  severity,  and  the  importance  that  pa-  tients  attach  to  individual  symptoms.  556  UROLOGY  JUNE  [990  VOLUME  XXXV,  NUMBER  6  </p>
                                        
                                            <p>7. It  is  noteworthy  that  at  one  and  a  half  years  after  the  start  of  the  study,  44  percent  of  the  patients  who  completed  the  three-month  treat-  ment  period  have  continued  treatment  -with  PPS  for  ongoing  periods  ranging  from  six  months  to  one  and  a  half  years.  This  indicates  that  this  proportion  of  patients  considers  PPS  to  be  effective  enough  to  continue  its  use  on  a  long-term  basis  and  attests  to  the  efficacy  of  this  medication  for  the  relief  of  the  symptoms  of  in-  terstitial  cystitis.  It  is  important  to  note  that  these  positive  re-  sults  for  PPS  were  achieved  in  a  selected  popu-  lation  of  patients  who  had  previously  failed  to  experience  satisfactory  relief  with  conventional  treatments  such  as  DMSO,  ehlorpaetin,  and  others,  It  is  not  unlikely  that  in  a  group  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  who  have  not  been  found  to  be  refractory  to  treatment,  the  propor-  tion  of  patients  responding  to  treatment  would  be  greater.  The  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  was  higher  among  the  placebo-treated  patients  than  the  PPS-treated  group,  but  the  difference  was  not  significant.  There  were  no  adverse  reactions  considered  to  be  serious.  Treatment  was  discon-  tinued  because  of  adverse  reactions  in  2  patients  receiving  placebo  and  in  1  patient  receiving  PPS.  Conclusions  In  this  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  both  efficacy  and  safety  of  PPS  for  the  relief  of  the  symptoms  of  interstitial  cystitis  have  been  confirmed.  Both  patients  and  investi-  gators  evaluated  PPS  as  significantly  more  ef-  fective  than  placebo  overall.  For  pain  and  urgency,  the  improvements  due  to  PPS  com-  pared  with  placebo  were  statistically  significant  or  approached  significance.  In  terms  of  the  voided  volume  parameters,  the  improvements  favored  PPS  over  placebo,  although  the  dif-  ferences  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  changes  in  frequency  were  similar  in  both  groups,  as  were  adverse  reactions  and  changes  in  laboratory  values.
